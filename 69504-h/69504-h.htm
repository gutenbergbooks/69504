<p class="center">CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE NORTHERN WHALE FISHERIES.</p>


<p>In the early ages of the world, when beasts of
prey began to multiply and annoy the vocations
of man, the personal dangers to which he must
have been occasionally exposed would oblige
him to contrive some means of defence. For
this end, he would naturally be induced, both
to prepare weapons, and also to preconceive
plans for resisting the disturbers of his peace.
His subsequent rencounters with beasts of prey
would, therefore, be more frequently successful,
not only in effectually repelling them when
they should attack him, but also, in some
instances, in accomplishing their destruction.
Hence, we can readily and satisfactorily
trace to the principles of necessity the adroitness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and courage evidenced by the unenlightened
nations of the world, in their successful
attacks on the most formidable of the brute
creation; and hence we can conceive that
necessity may impel the indolent to activity,
and the coward to actions which would not
disgrace the brave. For man to attempt to
subdue an animal whose powers and ferocity
he regarded with superstitious dread, and the
motion of which he conceived would produce a
vortex sufficient to swallow up his boat, or any
other vessel in which he might approach it—an
animal of at least six hundred times his own
bulk, a stroke of the tail of which might hurl
his boat into the air, or dash it and himself to
pieces—an animal inhabiting at the same time
an element in which he himself could not subsist;
for man to attempt to subdue such an
animal, under such circumstances, seems one of
the most hazardous enterprizes of which the
intercourse with the irrational world could possibly
admit. And yet this animal is successfully
attacked, and seldom escapes when once
he comes within reach of the darts of his
assailer.</p>

<p>It seems to be the opinion of most writers on
the subject of the whale-fishery, that the Biscayans
were the first who succeeded in the
capture of the whale. This opinion, though
perhaps not correct, deserves to be mentioned in
the outset of an investigation into the probable
origin of this employment. A species of whale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
probably the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Balæna rostrata</i>, was a frequent
visitor to the shores of France and Spain. In
pursuit of herrings and other small fishes, these
whales would produce a serious destruction
among the nets of the fishermen of Biscay and
Gascony. Concern for the preservation of their
nets, which probably constituted the whole of
their property, would naturally suggest the necessity
of driving these intruding monsters from
their coasts. With this view, arrows and spears,
and subsequently gunpowder, would be resorted
to. Finding the whales timid and inoffensive,
the fishers would be induced to approach some
individual of the species, and even to dart their
spears into its body. Afterwards they might
conceive the possibility of entangling some of
the species, by means of a cord attached to a
barbed arrow or spear. One of these animals
being captured, and its value ascertained, the
prospect of emolument would be sufficient to
establish a fishery of the cetaceous tribe, and
lead to all the beneficial effects which have
resulted in modern times.</p>

<p>Those authorities, indeed, may be considered
as unquestionable, which inform us that the
Basques and Biscayans, so early as the year
1575, exposed themselves to the perils of a
distant navigation, with a view to measure
their strength with the whales, in the midst of
an element constituting the natural habitation
of these enormous animals; that the English, in
1594, fitted an expedition for Cape Breton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
intended for the fishery of the whale and the
walrus, (sea-horse,) pursued the walrus-fishing
in succeeding years in high northern latitudes,
and, in 1611, first attacked the whale near the
shores of Spitzbergen; and that the Hollanders,
and subsequently other nations of Europe, participated
in the risk and advantages of these
northern expeditions. Some researches, however,
on the origin of this fishery, carried on in
the northern seas, will be sufficient to rectify
the error of these conclusions, by proving
that the whale-fishery by Europeans may
be traced as far back at least as the ninth
century.</p>

<p>The earliest authenticated account of a
fishery for whales is probably that contained in
Ohthere’s voyage, by Alfred the Great. This
voyage was undertaken about 890, by Ohthere,
a native of Halgoland, in the diocese of Dronthein,
a person of considerable wealth in his
own country, from motives of mere curiosity,
at his own risk, and under his personal superintendence.
On this occasion, Ohthere
sailed to the northward, along the coast of
Norway, round the North Cape, to the entrance
of the White Sea. Three days after
leaving Dronthein, or Halgoland, “he was
come as far towards the north as commonly
the whale-hunters used to travel.” Here
Ohthere evidently alludes to the hunters of the
walrus, or sea-horse; but subsequently, he
speaks pointedly as to a fishery for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
species of cetaceous animals having been at that
period practised by the Norwegians. He told
the king, that with regard to the common kind
of whales, the place of most and best hunting for
them was in his own country, “whereof some
be forty-eight ells of length and some fifty,”
of which sort, he affirmed, that he himself was
one of the six who, in the space of three (two)
days, killed threescore.</p>

<p>From this it would appear, that the whale-fishery
was not only prosecuted by the Norwegians
so early as the ninth century, but
that Ohthere himself had personal knowledge
of it. The voyage of Ohthere is a document
of much value in history, both in respect
to the matter of it, and the high character of
the author by whom it has been preserved.
By a slight alteration in the reading of the
Saxon manuscript, as suggested by Turner, in
his History of the Anglo-Saxons, it is possible
to suppose that the threescore animals slain by
Ohthere in two days were not whales but dolphins.
This supposition removes the improbability
of the exploit recorded, and does not
contradict or explain away the fact of larger
whales having been likewise hunted and captured.</p>

<p>A Danish work, which there is reason to
believe is of a date much earlier than that
which we assign to the first fishery of the
Basques, declares that the Icelanders were in the
habit of pursuing the whales, which they killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
on the shore, and that these islanders subsisted
on the flesh of some one of the species. And
Langebek does not hesitate to assert, that the
fishery of the whale (<em>hovlfangst</em>, by which he
probably means a species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delphinus</i>,) was
practised in the most northern countries of
Europe in the ninth century.</p>

<p>Under the date of 875, in a book entitled the
“Translation and Miracles of St. Vaast,” mention
is made of the whale-fishery on the French
coast. In the “Life of St. Arnould, bishop of
Soissons,” a work of the eleventh century, particular
mention is made of the fishery by the
harpoon, on the occasion of a miracle said
to have been performed by the saint. There
are also different authorities for supposing that
a whale-fishery was carried on near the coast
of Normandy and Flanders, from the eleventh
to the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The English, it is to be expected, did not
remain long behind their continental neighbours
in this lucrative pursuit. It is difficult
to determine whether the whales referred to in
the few early documents which we possess, were
such as were run on the English shore by accident,
or subdued by the English on the high sea.
By Acts of Parliament, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1315 and 1324,
the wrecks of whales, cast by chance upon the
shore, or whales or great sturgeons <em>taken</em> in
the sea, were to belong to the king. Henry <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>
gave, in 1415, to the church of Rochester,
the tithe of the whales taken along the shores<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
of that bishopric. In the sixteenth century,
the inhabitants of the shores of the Bay of
Biscay were the most distinguished whale-fishers.
At first, they confined their attacks
to those animals, probably the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Balæna rostrata</i>
of Linnæus, which used to present themselves
in the Bay of Biscay at a certain season
every year. Gradually becoming bolder, the
Biscayans advanced towards the coasts of
Iceland, Greenland, and Newfoundland, in the
pursuit. The Icelanders united their energies
with the Biscayans, and conducted the whale-fishery
on so extensive a scale, that, towards
the end of the sixteenth century, the number
of vessels annually employed by the united
nations amounted to a fleet of fifty or sixty
sail.</p>

<p>The first attempt of the English to capture
the whale, of which we have any satisfactory
account, was made in the year 1594. Different
ships were fitted out for Cape Breton at the
entrance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, part of
which were destined for the walrus-fishery, and
the remainder for the whale-fishery. The
Grace, of Bristol, one of these vessels, took
on board 700 or 800 whale-fins, or laminæ of
whalebone, which they found in the Bay of
St. George, where two large Biscayan fishermen
had been wrecked three years before.
This is the first notice I have met with of
the importation of this article into Great
Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>However doubtful it might have appeared at
one time whether the English or the Dutch
first visited Spitzbergen, the claim of the
English to the discovery and first practice of
the whale-fishery on the coasts of these islands
stands undisputed, the Dutch themselves allowing
that the English preceded them four years.
The merchants of Hull, who were ever remarkable
for their assiduous and enterprizing spirit,
fitted out ships for the whale-fishery so early
as the year 1598, which they continued regularly
to prosecute on the coasts of Iceland and
near the North Cape for several years; and
after the re-discovery of Spitzbergen by Hudson,
in 1607, they were the first to push forward
to its coasts. Captain Jonas Poole was,
in the year 1610, sent out on a voyage of discovery
by the “Company for the Discovery of
unknown Countries,” the “Muscovy Company,”
or the “Russia Company,” as it was subsequently
denominated. On his return, the company
fitted out two ships for the fishery; the
Marie Margaret, of 160 tons, under the direction
of Thomas Edge, factor; and the Elizabeth,
of 60 tons, Jonas Poole, master. In this
voyage, both ships were lost, but the cargo was
brought home in a Hull ship.</p>

<p>Such a novel enterprize as the capture of
whales, which was rendered practical, and even
easy, by the number in which they were found,
and the convenience of the situations in which
they occurred—an enterprize at the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
calculated to enrich the adventurers far beyond
any other branch of trade then practised—created
a great agitation, and drew towards it
the attention of all the commercial people of
Europe. With that eagerness which men invariably
display in the advancement of their
worldly interests, but which is seldom directed
with equal vigour to objects of higher and
eternal importance, the mercantile spirit was
concentrated on this new quarter, and vessels
from various ports began to be fitted for the
fishery. In the next year, three foreign ships
made their appearance along with the two
belonging to the Russia Company. The English,
jealous of the interference of the Dutch,
would not allow them to fish, and obliged them
to return home. In the following year, the
English Russia Company obtained a royal
charter, excluding all others, both natives and
foreigners, from the fishery, and they equipped
seven armed vessels for the purpose of maintaining
their prerogative. In the course of the
season, the English attacked the foreign vessels,
and took from them the greater proportion of
the blubber, or oil, and whale-fins, which they
had procured, driving them, together with some
English ships fitted out by private individuals,
out of the country. In 1614, a company was
established in Amsterdam, and a charter obtained
for three years; ships of war were sent
out, and the Hollanders, in defiance of the
English, were able to fish without interruption.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
The English got but half-laden, and the Dutch
made but a poor fishing. After various disagreements,
and the arrival of the vessels of
other powers on the fishing-stations, which
tended to divide the quarrel, a conference for
the purpose of adjusting their differences ensued
between the captains of the rival nations,
and they agreed at length to a division of those
fine bays and commodious harbours with which
the whole coast of Spitzbergen abounded. The
English obtained the first choice, and a greater
number of bays and harbours than any of the
rest. After the English, the Dutch, Danes,
Hamburghers, and Biscayans, and, finally, the
Spaniards and French, took up their positions.
Thus we perceive the origin of the names of the
different places called English Bay, Hollanders’
Bay, Danes’ Bay, etc.</p>

<p>These arrangements having been adopted,
each nation prosecuted the fishery in its own
possession, or along the sea-coast, which was
free for all. It was understood, however, that
the ships of any nation might resort to any of
the bays or harbours whatever, for the convenience
of awaiting a favourable wind, taking
refuge from a storm, or any other emergency.
To prevent the prosecution of the fishery in
bays belonging to other nations, it was agreed
that whenever a boat was lowered in a strange
harbour, or happened to row into the same,
the harpoon was always to be removed from
its rest, so as not to be in readiness for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>All the early adventurers on the whale-fishery
were indebted to the Biscayans for
their superintendence and help. They were
the harpooners, and the coopers “skilful in
setting up the staved cask.” At this period,
each ship carried two principals; the commander,
who was a native, was properly the
navigator, as his chief charge consisted in conducting
the ship to and from Greenland; the
other, who was called by the Dutch, specksynder,
or cutter of the fat, as his name implies,
was a Biscayan, and had the unlimited
control of the people in the fishery, and, indeed,
every operation belonging to it was
entirely confided to him. When, however, the
fishery became better known, the commander
assumed the general superintendence, and the
specksynder, or specksioneer, is now the principal
harpooner, and has the “ordering of the
fat,” and the extracting or boiling of the oil of
the whale, but serves under the direction of
the commander.</p>

<p>The Dutch pursued the whale-fishery with
more vigour than the English, and with still
better effect. It was no uncommon thing for
them to procure such vast quantities of oil that
empty ships were required to take home the
superabundant produce. In 1622, the charter
of the Amsterdam Company was renewed for
twelve years, and the charter of the Zealand
Society was extended about the same time,
whereby the latter were allowed to establish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
themselves in Jan Mayen Island, and to erect
boiling-houses and cooperages in common with
their associates. The privileges of these companies,
occasioning the exclusion of all other
persons belonging to the United Provinces,
produced a considerable degree of discontent,
when the fishery, towards the expiration of these
last charters, was in its most flourishing state.
The states-general of Friesland were induced
to grant a charter to a company formed in that
province, which endowed them with similar
privileges to those of the other companies of
Holland. The Frieslanders, in the year 1634,
perceived the advantage of procuring the sanction
of the Zealand and Amsterdam companies
to their right to participate in the fishery, and
after negotiation, the three companies, according
to stipulated conditions, contracted a triple
union. The Dutch followed the whale-fishery
with perseverance and profit, and were successfully
imitated by the Hamburghers and other
fishermen of the Elbe, but the English made
only occasional voyages.</p>

<p>It became apparent to the adventurers in
the whale-fishery, that considerable advantages
might be realized could Spitzbergen be resorted
to as a permanent residence, and they were
desirous of ascertaining the possibility of the
human species subsisting throughout the winter
in this inhospitable climate. The English merchants
offered considerable rewards, and the
Russia Company procured the reprieve of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
culprits who were convicted of capital offences,
to whom they promised pardon and a pecuniary
remuneration if they would remain a single
year in Spitzbergen. The fear of immediate
death induced them to comply; but when they
were carried out and showed the desolate,
frozen, and frightful country they were to
inhabit, they shrank back with horror, and
solicited to be returned home to suffer death
in preference to encountering such appalling
dangers. With this request the captain who
had them in charge humanely complied, and
on their return to England the company interceded
on their behalf, and procured pardon.</p>

<p>Probably it was about the same time that
nine men, who were by accident separated from
one of the London fishing-ships, were left behind
in Spitzbergen; all of them perished in
the course of the winter, and their bodies were
found in the ensuing summer shockingly
mangled by beasts of prey. The same master
who abandoned these poor wretches to so miserable
a fate was obliged, by the drifting of the
ice towards the shore, to leave eight of his
crew, who were engaged in hunting reindeer
for provision for the passage home, in the year
1630. These men, like the former, were
abandoned to their fate; for on proceeding to
the usual places of resort and rendezvous, they
perceived with horror that their own, together
with all the other fishing-ships, had departed.
By means of the provisions procured by hunting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the fritters of the whale left in boiling the
blubber, and the accidental supplies of bears,
foxes, seals, and sea-horses, together with the
judicious application of the buildings which
were erected in Bell Sound, where they took up
their abode, they were enabled not only to support
life, but even to maintain their health
little impaired, until the arrival of the fleet in
the following year. It is surely permitted us to
hope, that amidst the retirement and dreariness
of these frozen regions, these hardy sailors
found opportunities for serious reflection and
prayer to the God of heaven, and that their
minds, with eternity so near to them, were sufficiently
acquainted with the one way of salvation
to yield themselves to Him who is able
to preserve his servants unto life eternal.</p>

<p>The preservation of these men revived in
the Dutch the desire of establishing colonies,
and in consequence of certain encouragements
proclaimed throughout the fleet, seven men
volunteered their services, were landed at Amsterdam
Island, furnished with the needful
articles of provisions, etc., and were left by the
fleet on the 30th of August, 1633. About the
same time, another party, likewise consisting of
seven volunteers, were landed on Jan Mayen
Island, and left by their comrades to endure
the like painful service with the former. On
the return of the fleet in the succeeding year,
this last party were all found dead from the
effects of the scurvy; but the other, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
left in Spitzbergen, nine degrees further towards
the north, all survived. Other seven volunteers
proposed to repeat the experiment in Spitzbergen
during the ensuing winter, and were quitted
by their comrades on the 11th of September,
1634. They all fell victims to the scurvy.</p>

<p>The Dutch, encouraged by the hope that the
profitable nature of the whale-fishery would continue
unabated, incurred very great expenses in
making secure, ample, and permanent erections,
which they gradually extended in such a degree
that at length they assumed the form of a respectable
village, to which, from the Dutch
words “smeer,” signifying fat, and “bergen,”
to put up, they gave the name of Smeerenberg.
Their expectations of continued success were
not, however, justified, and the fishery began to
decline so rapidly from the year 1636-7, to the
termination of the company’s charters, that their
losses are stated on some occasions to have exceeded
their former profits. On the expiration
of the charters, in the year 1642, their renewal
was refused by the states-general, and the trade
was laid entirely open to all adventurers. It
increased in consequence almost tenfold; and
on the dissolution of the monopoly, the shipping
in the whale-fishery commerce accumulated to
between two and three hundred sail. Prior to
the time when the trade was laid open, the Jan
Mayen whale-fishery, like that of Spitzbergen,
attained its maximum. The prodigious destruction
of whales occasioned their withdrawal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and the island was at length abandoned as a
whale-fishing station.</p>

<p>The whale-fishery of the Dutch was somewhat
suspended by the war with England in
1653; but between the years 1660 and 1670,
four or five hundred sail of Dutch and Hamburgh
ships were yearly visitants to the coasts
of Spitzbergen, while the English sometimes did
not send a single ship. The British government
saw with regret such a profitable and
valuable speculation entirely laid aside. To
encourage, therefore, its renewal, an Act of
Parliament was passed in 1672, whereby the
rigours of the Navigation Act were dispensed
with, and its essential properties so modified for
the ten following years that a vessel for the
whale-fishery, being British-built, and having a
master and one-half of the crew British subjects,
might carry natives of Holland, or other expert
fishers, to the amount of the other half. In the
year 1693 was formed the “Company of Merchants
of London, trading to Greenland,” to
whom was granted an extension of the indulgences
allowed by this Act of Parliament. From
various losses, combined, probably, with unskilful
management, this company was so
unfortunate that, before the conclusion of their
term, their capital of £82,000 was entirely
expended. These circumstances tended much
to discourage the subjects of Great Britain from
making any vigorous attempt to renew the
fishery. The direct importation of Greenland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
produce into England being inconsiderable, its
importation from Holland or other foreign
states was permitted; whalebone, however, was
required to be brought into the country in fins
only, and not cut, or in any way manufactured;
nor could it be landed before the duty chargeable
thereon was secured or paid, under penalty of
the forfeiture of the goods and double their
value. Immense sums were annually paid to
foreigners for whalebone at this period.</p>

<p>It was not, it appears, until the whale-fishery
was on the decline at Spitzbergen, that the
Davis’s Strait fishery was resorted to. The
Dutch sent their first ships in the year 1719.
The shipping employed in the Greenland and
Davis’s Strait whale-fisheries, in 1721, by foreign
nations, amounted to three hundred and fifty-five
sail. When, by the lapse of some years,
the unfavourable impression produced on the
minds of speculative persons by the immense
losses suffered by English adventurers in the
whale-fishery had partly worn off, the propriety
of attempting this trade was suggested by
Henry Elking, and was proposed to the directors
of the well-known South Sea Company.
The British legislature, by exempting the produce
of the Greenland Seas from existing duties
on the condition of its being imported in British
ships, held out encouragements to the company
similar to those offered to former adventurers.
The South Sea Company caused a fleet of
twelve new ships, about 306 tons’ burden each,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to be built in the river Thames, equipped each
vessel with the necessary supplies of cordage,
casks, and fishing instruments, and engaged for
their use the duke of Bedford’s wet-dock at
Deptford, where boiling-houses and other conveniences
were constructed. In the spring of
1725, the fleet being all in readiness, put to
sea, and returned safe with twenty-five and a
half whales. The proceeds of this voyage,
though scarcely sufficient to pay the expenses
incurred by the fitments and the hire of foreign
harpooners, were yet superior to those of any
succeeding year during the period in which the
company pursued the trade. For eight successive
years the company persevered in the whale-fishery,
with indifferent or bad success, and
after the season of 1732 were compelled to
abandon it. In 1736, a London ship, which
visited the whale-fishery, procured a cargo of
seven fish—a degree of success which was fortunately
different from that of most of the antecedent
English whalers. The English government
offered a bounty of twenty shillings per
ton on the burden or tonnage of all British
whale-fishing ships of 200 tons or upwards;
and this, in 1749, was increased to forty shillings
per ton.</p>

<p>Gradually the British whale-fishery began to
assume a respectable and hopeful appearance.
The combined fleets of England and Scotland,
in the year 1752, amounted to forty sail; in
1753, to forty-nine; in 1754, to sixty-seven, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
1755, to eighty-two; and in the year following, to
eighty-three sail—which was the greatest number
of ships employed in the trade for the twenty
years following; while the least number amounted
to forty sail during the same period. On the
establishment of the British whale-fishery, the
legislature directed its attention to the means for
securing the perpetuity of the trade, and the
economical application of the bounty. These
enactments were not carried in the House of
Commons without considerable debate. In 1768,
the king of Prussia, interesting himself in the
Greenland fishery, caused some ships to be
equipped from Emden; and in 1784, the king
of France attempted the revival of the whale-fishery,
by equipping, at his own expense, six
ships in the port of Dunkirk. In 1785, the
king of Denmark, in imitation of the English,
granted a bounty of about thirty shillings sterling
per ton, to all vessels in the Greenland and
Iceland fisheries, on the condition of the ships
being fitted out and their cargoes sold in a
Danish port.</p>

<p>The Act of the British Parliament of 1786,
embodying several additional regulations on
the subject of the whale-fishery, and rehearsing
and revising former acts, has ever since been
considered the fundamental act on the subject
of the Greenland and Davis’s Strait whale-fishery.
By accounts laid upon the table of the
House of Commons during this session, it appeared
that the bounties granted for the encouragement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of the British whale-fisheries, carried
on in the Greenland Sea and Davis’s Strait,
from the year 1733, when bounties were first
given, to the end of 1785, had amounted
to £1,064,272. 18<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> for England, and
£202,158. 16<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em> for Scotland. By a subsequent
act, the bounty was reduced to twenty-five
shillings per ton, from the 25th of December,
1792, to the 25th of December,
1795; and from this period until the expiration
of the act in 1798, to twenty shillings
per ton, at which latter rate it has continued
ever since. From a list, it appears, that in
1788, 255 British ships sailed for the whale-fishery,
of which 129 were of a burden under
300 tons; 97 of 300 to 350 tons; 16 of 350 to
400 tons; 11 of 400 to 500 tons; 1 of 565
tons; and 1 of 987 tons. They were fitted out
from the ports of London, Hull, Liverpool,
Whitby, Newcastle, Yarmouth, Sunderland,
Lynn, Leith, Ipswich, Dunbar, Aberdeen, Bo’ness,
Glasgow, Montrose, Dundee, Exeter,
Whitehaven, Stockton, Greenock, Scarborough,
Grangemouth, and Queensferry.</p>

<p class="center">SITUATION OF THE EARLY WHALE-FISHERY—THE MANNER
IN WHICH IT WAS CONDUCTED—AND THE ALTERATIONS
WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE.</p>



<p>Immediately after the discovery of Spitzbergen
by Hudson, in the year 1607, the walrus-fishers,
who carried on an extensive and profitable
business at Cherie Island, finding the animals
of their pursuit become shy and less abundant,
extended their voyage to the northward, until
they fell in with Spitzbergen, the newly discovered
country, about the time when the Russian
Company equipped their first ships for the
Greenland whale-fishery. As the coast abounded
with whales and sea-horses, Cherie Island was
deserted, and Spitzbergen became the scene of
future enterprize. At this time, the mysticetus
was found in immense numbers throughout the
whole extent of the coast, and in the different
capacious bays with which it abounds. Never
having been disturbed, these animals were
unconscious of danger; they allowed themselves
to be so closely approached that they fell an
easy prey to the courageous fishermen. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
not necessary that the ships should cruise
abroad, throughout the extended regions of the
Polar Seas, as they do at the present time, for
the whales being abundant in the bays, the
ships were anchored in some convenient situation,
and generally remained at their moorings
until their cargoes were completed. Not only
did the coast of Spitzbergen abound with
whales, but the shore of Jan Mayen Island, in
proportion to its extent, afforded them in like
abundance.</p>

<p>The method used for capturing whales, at
this period, was usually by means of the harpoon
and lance, though the Dutch inform us
that the English made use of nets made with
strong ropes for the purpose. The harpoon,
which was the instrument used in general practice
for effecting their entanglement, consisted,
as at present, of a barbed or arrow-shaped iron
dart, two or three feet in length, to which was
attached a wooden handle, for convenience in
striking or throwing it into the whale. Fastened
to the harpoon was a line or rope three
hundred fathoms in length; more than sufficient
to reach the bottom in the bays, where
the depth of the water seldom exceeds eighty
or one hundred fathoms; so that on a fish
descending after being struck, the end of the
line could always be detained in the boat.
The movements of this boat, of course, corresponded
with those of the whale; and so
closely pointed out its position, that, on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
reappearance at the surface, the other assisting
boats were usually very near the place. It was
then vigorously pursued, secured by a sufficient
number of harpoons, and lastly attacked repeatedly
with lances until it was killed.</p>

<p>The lance in use was an iron spear with
a wooden handle, altogether ten or twelve feet
in length. The capture of the fish, in which,
owing to the particular excellence of the situation,
they seldom failed, being accomplished, it
was towed by the boats, rowing one before
another “like a team of horses,” to the ship’s
stern, where it lay untouched from one to two
or three days. The fat being then removed
was carried to the shore, where ample conveniences
being erected, it was afterwards subjected
to heat in a boiler, and the greater part
of the oil extracted.</p>

<p>As the usual process of the early fishers for
extracting the oil may be interesting to some
readers, I shall attempt to describe it, following
the accounts by captains Anderson and Gray,
whose papers are preserved among the manuscripts
in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The blubber being made fast to the shore,
a “waterside man,” standing in a pair of boots,
mid-leg in the sea, flayed off the fleshy parts,
and cut the blubber into pieces, of about two
hundred weight each. Two men, with a
barrow, then carried it, piece by piece, to a
stage or platform, erected by the side of the
works, where a man, denominated a “stage-cutter,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
armed with a long knife, sliced it into
pieces, one and a half inches thick, and about
a foot long, and then pushed it into an adjoining
receptacle, called a “slicing cooler.” Immediately
beyond this cooler, five or six choppers
were arranged in a line, with blocks of
whales’ tails before them; and adjoining these
blocks was another vessel, called a “chopping
cooler,” of two or three tons’ capacity. These
men, being situated between the two coolers,
took the sliced blubber from the slicing cooler,
and, after reducing it into little bits, scarcely
one-fourth of an inch thick, and an inch or two
long, pushed it into the chopping cooler. These
operations were carried on as near as convenient
to the place where the copper was
erected.</p>

<p>The copper held only half a ton. It was
furnished with a furnace, and the requisite
appendages. A man, designated “tub-filler,”
with a ladle of copper, was employed in filling
a hogshead with chopped blubber, dragging it
to the copper, and emptying it in, until the
copper was full. A fire of wood was, in the
first instance, applied, but after a copper or
two had been boiled, the finks or fritters were
always sufficient to boil the remainder without
any other fuel. When the blubber was sufficiently
boiled, two men, called “copper men,”
with two long-handled copper ladles, took the
oil and finks out of the copper, and put it into
a “fritter barrow,” which, being furnished with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
a grating of wood in place of a bottom, drained
the oil from the fritters, from whence it ran
into a wooden tank or cooler, of about five tons’
capacity. Three coolers were usually provided,
and placed some feet asunder, a little below
each other; a quantity of water was put into
each before the oil, and the oil, whenever it
came to a certain height in the first cooler,
escaped through a hole, by a spout, into the
second, the same way into the third, and from
thence, by a plug-hole, into the casks or butts
in readiness for its reception. When the oil in
these butts was thoroughly cold, whatever it
had contracted was filled up, and the casks
then rolled into the water, and, in rafts of
twenty together, were conveyed into the ship.</p>

<p>The whalebone was separated from the gum,
or substance in which it is imbedded, rubbed
clean, packed in bundles, of sixty laminæ or
blades each, and taken to the ship in the longboat.
Thus prepared, the cargo was conveyed
home, either when a sufficiency was procured,
or the close of the season put an end to the
fishing occupations. While some of the people
belonging to the whale-ships were engaged in
boiling the blubber, the rest of the crew, it is
probable, were occasionally employed in the
capture of other whales. Besides the buildings
made use of in boiling the blubber, the whale-fishers
had other buildings on shore for lodging
the blubber-men in, and for the use of the
coopers employed in preparing the casks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>So long as the whales remained in the immediate
vicinity of the fishing establishments,
the boats were sent out of the bay, the fish
captured at sea, towed into the harbour, stripped
of the fat, and the blubber boiled in the manner
described; but as the whales increased
their distance, this plan of procedure became
inconvenient, so that the ships began to cruise
about the sea, to kill the whales wherever they
found them, to take on board the blubber, and
only occasionally to enter a port. So far now
from having occasion for empty ships for carrying
away the superabundant produce, it was
a matter of difficulty and uncertainty to procure
a cargo at all; and, with the most prosperous
issue, there was not sufficient time for landing
the cargo and extracting the oil; the blubber
was therefore merely packed in casks and conveyed
home, where the remaining operations of
extracting the oil, and cleaning and preparing
the whalebone, were completed. Hence, the
various buildings, which had been erected at
a great expense, became perfectly useless; the
coppers, and other apparatus that were worth
the removal, were taken away, and the buildings
of all the different nations, both at Spitzbergen
and at Jan Mayen Island, were either
wantonly razed to the ground, or suffered to fall
into a state of decay.</p>

<p>When the whales first approached the borders
of the ice, the fishers held the ice in such dread,
that whenever an entangled fish ran towards it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
they immediately cut the line. Experience,
through time, inured them to it; occasionally
they ventured among the loose ice, and the
capture of small whales at fields was at length
attempted, and succeeded. Some adventurous
persons sailed to the east side of Spitzbergen,
where the current, it is believed, has a tendency
to turn the ice against the shore; yet
here, finding the sea, on some occasions, open,
they attempted to prosecute the fishery, and, it
seems, with some success, a great whale-fishery
having been made near Stansforeland, in the
year 1700. The retreat of the whales from the
bays to the sea-coast, thence to the banks at a
distance from land, thence to the borders of the
ice, and finally to the sheltered situations
afforded by the ice, appears to have been fully
accomplished about the year 1700, or from that
to 1720. The plan of prosecuting the fishery
now underwent a material change, especially in
reference to the construction of the ships, and
the quality and quantity of the fishing apparatus.</p>

<p>When the fishery could be effected entirely
in the bay, or even along the sea-coast, any
vessels which were sea-worthy, however old or
tender, were deemed sufficient to proceed to
Spitzbergen, and were generally found adequate
to the purpose, especially as they did not
set out till the spring was far advanced, thereby
avoiding obstructions from the ice and from
sudden and destructive storms. When, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the fishing had to be pursued in the open
sea, new, or at least very substantial ships, became
requisite, and even these it was found
necessary to strengthen on the bows and stern,
and on the sides, by additional planks. A
greater quantity of fishing-stores also became
needful. When fishing among the ice, the
whales, after having been struck, frequently
penetrated to a great distance out of the reach
of their assailants, dragging the line away,
until at length they found it necessary to cut
it to prevent further loss. Hence, by the frequency
of disasters among their ships, the increased
expense of their equipment, and the
liability of losing their fishing-materials, such
an additional expense was occasioned as required
the practice of the most rigid economy
to counterbalance it. The destruction of the
shipping by the ice, in the Dutch fleet alone,
was frequently near twenty sail in one year,
and on some occasions above that number.
The Greenland men of the present day being
mostly ice-fishers, an account of the improved
mode of fishing now practised will be sufficient
for the illustration of the method followed by
the Dutch and other nations at a more early
period, particularly as the way in which the
whale is pursued and killed is pretty nearly
the same at this time as it was a hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>Davis’s Strait, or the sea lying between the
west side of Old Greenland and the east side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
North America, and its most northern islands,
has generally, since the close of the seventeenth
century, been the scene of an advantageous
whale-fishery. This fishery was first attempted
by the Dutch, in 1719; after which period it
was usually resorted to by about three-tenths
of their whalers, while seven-tenths proceeded
to Spitzbergen. This fishery differs only from
that of Spitzbergen or Greenland, in the sea
being, in many districts, less incommoded with
ice, and in the climate being somewhat more
mild. The alterations which have taken place
in it are, in some measure, similar to those
which have occurred at Spitzbergen. The fish
which, half a century ago, appear to have resorted
to all parts of the western coast of Old
Greenland, in a few years retired to the northward,
but they still remained about the coast.
Of late, however, they have deserted some of
the bays which they formerly frequented, and
have been principally caught in icy situations
in a high latitude, or in the opening of Hudson’s
Strait, or at the borders of the western
ice, near the coast of Labrador.</p>

<p>Baffin’s Bay was suggested as an excellent
fishing-station, by the voyager whose name it
bears, so early as the year 1616, when his memorable
navigation was performed. Baffin, in
a letter addressed to J. Wostenholm, esq., observes,
that great numbers of whales occur in
the bay, and that they are easy to be struck;
and, though ships cannot reach the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
places until toward the middle of July, “yet
they may well tarry till the last of August, in
which space much business may be done, and
good store of oil made.” To this situation,
where the whales have never been molested
until recently, it appears they still resort in
the same manner, and in similar numbers,
as in the time of Baffin. In 1817, two or three
of the Davis’s Strait whalers proceeded through
the strait into Baffin’s Bay, to a much greater
length than they were in the habit of adventuring,
where, in the months of July and August,
they found the sea clear of ice, and in some
parts abounding with whales. A Leith ship,
which, it appears, advanced the furthest, made
a successful fishery in lat. 76°-77°, after the
season when it was usual for ships to depart.
This fact having become generally known, several
other ships followed the example, in the
season of 1818, and persevered through the
barrier of ice lying in 74°-75° towards the
north. After they had succeeded in passing this
barrier, they found, as in the preceding year, a
navigable sea, where several ships met with
considerable success in the fishery, at a very
advanced period of the season. This discovery
is likely to prove of great importance to the
fishery of Davis’s Strait. Ships, which fail of
success in the old stations, will still, in the new
fishery, have a reserve of the most promising
character. Hence, instead of this fishery being
necessarily closed in July, the period when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
whales have usually made their final retreat
from the old fishing-stations, it will in future be
extended to the end of August at least; and it
may ultimately appear that there will be little
danger of ships being permanently frozen up,
unless previously beset in the ice during any
part of the month of September.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">ACCOUNT OF THE MODERN WHALE-FISHERY, AS CONDUCTED
AT SPITZBERGEN.</p>


<p>We commence this chapter with a description
of a well-adapted Greenland ship, and of the
manner in which it should be strengthened to
resist the concussions of the ice. A ship intended
for the Greenland or Davis’s Strait trade,
should be of three or four hundred tons’ admeasurement,
very substantially built, doubled, and
fortified; should have six or seven feet perpendicular
space between decks; should be furnished
with a description of sails which are
easily worked; and should possess the property
of fast sailing. The most appropriate dimensions
of a ship intended for the northern whale-fisheries,
seems to be that which is so large as
to be capable of deriving the greatest advantage
from the best opportunity, and no larger. A
vessel of 250 tons requires nearly the same
number of men, the same quantity of provisions
and stores, and the same expense of outfit, as a
ship of 350 tons’ burden; while the difference in
the cargoes of the two vessels when filled, is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
one voyage more than a compensation for the
difference in the first expense. Besides, for
want of similar room and convenience, the
smaller ship has not always an equal chance of
succeeding in the fishery with the larger. And,
as ships of about 350 tons’ burden have been
occasionally filled, vessels of 250 tons are too
small for the fishery. Ships of 350 tons’ burden
have, we observe, been occasionally filled, but
we know of no instance in which a ship of 400
tons, of the usual capacious build, has been deficient
in capacity for taking in as large a cargo
as of late years there has been any opportunity
of procuring. We therefore conclude, that an
increase of dimensions above 400 tons is an
actual disadvantage, and that a ship of intermediate
size, between 300 and 400 tons, is best
adapted for the fishery.</p>

<p>Greenland ships, in the early ages of the
fishery, were very indifferent structures, and
even of late shipping of inferior quality were
generally deemed sufficient for the trade. At
present, however, when a good fishery is rarely
made without frequent exposure to the ice,
and sometimes in very critical situations, the
vessels require to be substantially built, for
the purpose of resisting the occasional pressure
of, and frequent blows from, the ice, to which
the ships of persevering fishermen must always
be more or less exposed. The requisites peculiar
to a Greenland ship, the intention of
which is to afford additional strength, consist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of doubling, and sometimes trebling, and fortifying.
The terms “doubling” and “trebling,”
are expressive of the number of layers of
planks, which are applied to the exterior of a
frame of timbers; hence, a ship which has one
additional series of planks, is said to be doubled,
and such ships as are furnished with two, or
part of two, additional layers of planks, are said
to be trebled. Doubling generally consists of
the application of two or two half inches oak
plank, near the bow, diminishing towards the
stern to perhaps half that thickness, and extending
in one direction from the lower part of
the main-wales, to within six feet perpendicular
of the keel forward, and to within eight or nine
feet abaft; and, in the other direction, that is,
fore and aft-wise, from the stem to the stern-post.
Doubling is used for producing an increase
of strength, and at the same time for
preserving the outside or main planks of the
ship from being injured by the friction of passing
ice. Trebling, which commonly consists of
one and a half to two inches oak plank, is generally
confined to the bows of the ship, and rarely
extends farther aft than the fore-chains or chesstree.
It is seldom applied but to second-rate
ships. Its principal use is to increase the
strength of the ship about the bows, but it also,
serves to preserve that part of the doubling
which it covers from being destroyed by the
ice.</p>

<p>Fortifying is the operation of strengthening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
a ship’s stern and bows by the application of
timber and iron plates to the exterior, and
a vast number of timbers and stanchions to the
interior. Four straight substantial oak timbers,
called ice-beams, about twelve inches square and
twenty-five feet in length, are placed beneath
the hold-beams, butting with their foremost
extremity against a strong fore-hook, and extending
nearly at right angles across three or
four of the hold-beams, into each of which they
are notched and secured, at the point of intersection,
by strong iron bolts, with the addition
of “cleats” on the aftermost-beams. The fore-part
of the ice-beams, which butt against the
hook, are placed at a small distance from each
other, from whence they diverge in such a
way that their other extremities divide the
aftermost beams under which they pass into
five equal parts. The next important part of
the fortification is the <em>pointers</em>, which consist of
four or more crooked timbers, fitting the curve
of the ship’s bow on each side; these are placed
below the hold-beams, against the inside of the
ceiling, nearly parallel with the direction of the
planks, some butting against the fore-hooks,
and others passing between them. Across these
pointers, four or five smaller timbers, called
“riders,” disposed at regular distances, are
placed at right angles, that is, in the same direction
as the ribs of the ship. Now, from each
of the points of intersection of the riders and
pointers, consisting of eighteen or twenty on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
each side of the ship, a stanchion, or shore, proceeds
to the edge of one of the two ice-beams,
placed on the same side, where it is secured in
a rabbet. The ice-beams are supported and
connected by several strong pieces of wood,
placed between each two, in different parts,
called “carlings,” whereby they are made to
bear as one. It is evident that a blow received
on the starboard-bow will be impressed on the
adjoining pointers, and the impression communicated,
through the medium of the lateral
timbers, or shores, to the two ice-beams on the
same side, thence by the carlings to the other
ice-beams, and then, by the shores on the
opposite side to the larboard-bow and annexed
pointers. A blow cannot be received on any
part of one bow, without being communicated
by the fortification to every part of the opposite
bow, while every part to and through which
the impression is communicated must tend to
support that place on which the blow is impressed.</p>

<p>To preserve the stem from being shattered
or bruised by direct blows from the ice, it is
strengthened by an extra piece called the false,
or ice-stem. On the side of this are placed
the ice-knees, which are angular chocks, or
blocks of wood, filling the concavity formed by
the stem and bow planks, and extending from
about the eight feet mark to the loading mark.
In the best style, the ice-knees are twelve to
fifteen inches in thickness at the stem, diminishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
to, perhaps, six or eight inches thick
at the distance of about eight feet from the
stem, from thence gradually becoming thinner,
until they fall into and incorporate with the
common doubling, below the fore-part of the
fore-chains. This makes a neat bow, and in
point of strength is much preferable to the
angular chocks or knees, which usually extend
about five or six feet from the stem, and then
terminate somewhat abruptly upon the doubling.
Ice-knees not only strengthen the front of the
bows, and prevent the main planks from being
bruised or shattered, as far as they extend, but
likewise protect the stem from the twisting
effect of a side blow. The stem and the small
part of the ice-knees adjoining, are still farther
defended by plates of half-inch iron, called ice-plates,
which are nailed upon the face of the
ice-stem, and partly on the ice-knees, to prevent
them being cut by the ice.</p>

<p>For additional strength, as well as convenience,
the hold-beams of a Greenland ship should be
placed low, or at a greater distance from the
deck-beams than is usual in other merchantmen,
leaving a clear space of six or seven feet between
decks. The strength thus derived is principally
serviceable when the ship is squeezed between
two sheets of ice; because the nearer the pressure
acts on the extremities of the beams, the
greater is the resistance they are calculated to
offer. A large space between decks is found
also, for many reasons, to be most convenient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Hammocks, as receptacles for sailors’ beds,
being incommodious, the crew are lodged in
cabins or berths, erected in the half-deck; these
consist of twelve to twenty in number, each of
which is calculated to contain two or three
persons. When a ship is on fishing-stations,
the boats are required to be always ready
for use; as such they are suspended from
cranes, fixed on the sides of the ship, and are
usually so contrived that a boat can be lowered
down into the water, manned, and pushed off
from the ship, in the short space of a minute of
time. Prior to the year 1813, a ship having
seven boats carried one at each waist, that is,
between the main-mast and fore-mast, two at
each quarter, one above the other and one across
the stern. An improvement on this plan,
adopted in 1813, is to have the boats fixed in a
line of three lengths of boats on each side.</p>

<p>The masts and sails of a Greenland vessel
are not without their peculiarities. As it is an
object of importance that a fishing-ship should
be easily navigated, under common circumstances,
by a boat’s crew of six or seven men,
it is usual to take down royal masts, and even
top-gallant masts, and sometimes to substitute
a long light pole in place of a mizen top-mast;
also, to adopt such sails as require the least management.
Courses set in the usual way require a
number of men to work them when the ship is
tacked; a course, therefore, made to diminish
as it descends, that is, narrowest at the foot or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
lower part, and extended by a boom, or yard
below as well as above, and this boom fastened
by a tackle fixed at its centre to the deck,
swings with the yards, with little or no alteration,
and is found particularly convenient. Fore-sails,
on this principle, have been in use about
six or seven years. In 1816, I fitted a main-sail
or cross-jack, in the same way, the former
of which we found of admirable utility. Boom-courses
are not only convenient in tacking, but
are likewise a valuable acquisition when sailing
among crowded dangerous ice. As the safety
of the ship depends, next to the skilfulness of
the piloting officer, on a prompt management of
the yards and sails, boom-courses are strikingly
useful on account of the little attention they
require when any alteration in the position of
the sails becomes necessary; and when the
ship’s head-way is required to be suddenly
stopped in a situation where she cannot be
luffed into the wind, boom-courses swinging
simultaneously with the top-tails are backed
without any annoyance from tacks or sheets,
and of course assist materially in effecting the
intention. Such is the advantage of this description
of sails, that on one occasion, when all
the rest of my crew were engaged in the capture
of a whale, with the assistance of only two men,
neither of them sailors, I repeatedly tacked a
ship of 350 tons’ burden under three courses,
top-sails and top-gallant sails, together with jib
and mizen, in a strong breeze of wind. Gaf-sails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
between the masts, in the place of stay-sails,
are likewise deservedly in much repute. To
the mizen and try-sail, or gaf main-sail, that
have been long in use, I have added a gaf fore-sail
of similar form, besides which, my father
has also adopted gaf top-sails between each
mast. These sails produce an admirable effect
when a ship is “on a wind,” which is the kind
of sailing most required among the ice.</p>

<p>Having now described a Greenland ship, it is
time to detail the proceedings on board of her,
from putting to sea to her arrival on the coast
of Spitzbergen. When all necessary conditions
have been fulfilled, and the ship cleared out at
the custom-house, the first opportunity is embraced
for putting to sea. This is generally
accomplished in the course of the month of
March, or at least before the tenth of April.
The crew of a whale-ship usually consists of
forty to fifty men, comprising several classes of
officers, such as harpooners, boat-steerers, line-managers,
carpenters, coopers, etc., together
with fore-mast men, landmen, and apprentices.
As a stimulus to the crew in the fishery, every
individual, from the master down to the boys,
besides his monthly pay, receives a gratuity
for every size fish caught during the voyage, or
a certain sum for every tun of oil which the
cargo produces. Masters and harpooners, in
place of monthly wages, receive a small sum in
advance before sailing, and if they procure no
cargo whatever, they receive nothing more for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
their voyage; but in the event of a successful
fishing, their advantages are considerable. The
master usually receives three guineas for each
size fish, and as much for striking a size whale
or discovering a dead one, together with ten
shillings to twenty shillings per tun on oil, and
commonly a thirtieth, a twenty-fifth, or a twentieth
of the value of the cargo besides. He also
has about £5 per month for his attendance on
the ship while he remains on shore. Each
harpooner has usually 6<em>s.</em> per tun on oil, together
with half a guinea for every size fish he
may strike during the voyage. In addition to
which the chief-mate, who is generally also harpooner,
has commonly two guineas per month
when at sea, and a guinea for each size fish.
The specksioneer, or chief-harpooner, has also
half a guinea per fish, and sometimes a trifle
per tun of oil additional; and the second-mate,
and other officers who serve in a compound
capacity, have some additional monthly
wages. Boat-steerers, line-managers, and fore-mast-men,
commonly receive about 1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per
tun each, besides their monthly pay, and landmen
either a trifle per tun on oil, or a few
shillings for each size fish.</p>

<p>From the difference in the wages paid in different
ports, it is not easy to say what is the
amount received by each class of officers belonging
to the whale-ships. In the general,
however, it may be understood that, on a ship
with 200 tuns of oil, which is esteemed an excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
cargo, the chief-mate receives about £95
for his voyage, a harpooner about £70, and a
common sailor, or foremast-man, about £25.
including advance money and monthly pay.
As the master’s wages depend as much on the
value of the cargo as upon its quantity, it is
difficult to give an opinion as to the amount;
generally speaking, however, with a cargo of
200 tuns of oil, he will receive about £250
or £300, when his pay is according to the
lowest scale; and perhaps £500 or £600, or
upwards, when he is paid after the highest
rate.</p>

<p>In time of war, the <em>manning</em> of the whale-ships
at the ports where they were respectively
fitted out being sometimes impracticable, and
always a matter of difficulty, it was usual for
the owners and masters of such ships to avail
themselves of the privileges allowed by act of
parliament of completing their crews in Shetland
and Orkney. These islands were, therefore,
the frequent resort of most of the fishermen;
those bound for Spitzbergen commonly put into
Shetland, and those for Davis’s Strait into
Orkney. But in the present time of peace,
also, several ships, in consequence of the higher
wages demanded by the English seamen, have
availed themselves of a late extension of the act
for permitting a certain amount of extra men to
be taken on board in Shetland or Orkney,
during the continuance of the bounty system.</p>

<p>In Shetland, it is usual for the fishermen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
<em>trim</em> their ships, and complete their ballast, by
filling most of their empty casks with water,
where it has not previously been done, to replenish
their fresh water, to lay in stocks of
eggs, fish, fowls, sea-sand, etc., to divest the
ships of all elevated lumber and gaudy appendages
to the masts and rigging, by way of preparing
them for enduring the Polar storms with
greater safety and convenience, and lastly, to
fix a “crow’s nest” or “hurricane house,” on
the mast of each ship, and prepare a passage to
it as safe and convenient as possible.</p>

<p>The “crow’s nest” is an apparatus placed on
the main top-mast, or top-gallant mast-head, as
a kind of watch-tower for the use of the master
or officer of the watch in the fishing-seas, for
sheltering him from the wind, when engaged in
piloting the ship through crowded ice, or for obtaining
a more extensive view of the sea around
when looking out for whales. When sailing
among much drift-ice, as seen from the deck, it
seems at a small distance impervious, although
it may happen that scarcely any two pieces are
connected; but from the mast-head, the relative
position of almost every piece may be distinctly
seen, and an opinion may be formed by the experienced
observer of the probable and actual
movements of such pieces as the ship is required
to pass. This is an object of the greatest importance,
because the varied movements of the
different pieces occasion such an alteration in
the channel pursued, that, were it not for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
constant, attentive, and judicious watch by the
master or an able officer, a ship would not pass
through any crowded collection of drift-ice
without the imminent risk of being stove.</p>

<p>In difficult situations, a master’s presence at
the mast-head is sometimes required for many
hours in succession, when the temperature of
the air is from 10° to 20° below the freezing
point, or more. It is therefore necessary for
the preservation of his health, as well as
for his comfort, that he should be sheltered
from the piercing gale. A piece of canvas tied
round the head of the main top-mast, and heel
of the top-gallant mast, extending only from the
cap to the cross-trees, or at best, a canvas
stretched round the base of the top-gallant
rigging, but open on the after-part, was the
most complete contrivance of a crow’s nest, until
a few years ago my father invented an apparatus,
having the appearance of a rostrum,
which afforded an admirable defence against
the wind. This contrivance, from the comfortable
shelter it affords to the navigator, having
come into very general use, it may not be improper
to describe it more particularly.</p>

<p>The one most approved by the inventor is
about four and a half feet in length, and two and
a half in diameter. The form is cylindrical,
open above and close below. It is composed of
laths of wood, placed in a perpendicular position,
round the exterior edge of a strong wooden
hoop, forming the top, and round a plane of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
mahogany or other wood which forms the
bottom, and the whole circumference of the
cylinder is covered with canvas or leather. The
entrance is by a trap-hatch at the bottom. It
is fixed on the very summit of the main top-gallant
mast, from whence the prospect on
every side is unimpeded. On the after-side is
a seat, with a place beneath for a flag. In
other parts are receptacles for a speaking-trumpet,
telescope, and occasionally for a rifle-piece,
with utensils for loading. For the more
effectual shelter of the observer, when in an
erect posture, a movable screen is applied to
the top on the windward side, which increases
the height so much as effectually to shield his
head. When the ship is tacked, nothing more
is necessary for retaining the complete shelter
than shifting the screen to the opposite side,
which is done in an instant.</p>

<p>The Greenland ships usually leave Shetland
towards the end of March, or the beginning of
April. From thence, if their view be to avail
themselves of the benefit of the seal-fishery,
they steer to the northward, on the meridian,
or a little to the westward, and commonly make
the ice in the latitude of 70° to 72° north. But
if the month of April be much advanced before
they leave Shetland, they generally steer
for the whaling-stations on a course to the east
of north, with the view of falling into that remarkable
indentation of the Polar ice, lying in
5° or 10° east longitude, which I have denominated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the “Whale-Fishers’ Bight.” It used to
be the practice to remain on sealing-stations
until the beginning of May, and not to enter
the ice until about the middle of the month;
but of late it has become usual to push into the
ice at a much earlier period, though the practice
is neither without its dangers nor disadvantages.
If a barrier of ice prevents the fisher
from reaching the usual fishing-station, he
sometimes perseveres in search of whales on the
southward margin of the ice, but more generally
endeavours to push through it into an
opening, which is usually formed on the west
side of Spitzbergen, in the month of May,
where he seldom fails of meeting with the objects
of his search. It is a common remark,
that the more difficulty there is attending the
passage through the ice, the better is the fishery
when that passage is accomplished. In close
seasons, very few ships pass the barrier before
the middle or end of May. Those which first
succeed immediately proceed along the edge of
the western ice to the latitude of 78° or 79°,
until they meet with whales. But in open
seasons, the most recommendable plan is to
sail direct to the latitude of 80°, when it can
be accomplished at a very early period, where
large whales are generally at this season to be
found.</p>

<p>It is not yet ascertained what is the earliest
period of the year in which it is possible to fish
for whales. The danger attending the navigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
amidst massive drift-ice, in the obscurity
of night, is the most formidable objection
against attempting the fishery before the middle
of the month of April, when the sun, having
entered the northern tropic, begins to enlighten
the Polar regions throughout the twenty-four
hours. Some ships have sailed to the northward
of the 78th degree of latitude, before the
close of the month of March; but I am not
acquainted with a single instance where the
hardy fishers have, at this season, derived any
compensation for the extraordinary dangers to
which they were exposed. In the course of
the month of April, on certain occasions, considerable
progress has been made in the fishery,
notwithstanding the frequency of storms. At
the first stage of the business, in open seas, the
whales are usually found in most abundance on
the borders of the ice, near Hackluyt’s Headland,
in the latitude of 80°. A degree or two
further south they are sometimes seen, though
not in much plenty; but in the 76th degree
they sometimes occur in such numbers, as to
present a tolerable prospect of success in assailing
them.</p>

<p>Some rare instances have occurred wherein
they have been seen on the edge of the ice, extending
from Cherie Island to Point Look-out,
in the early part of the season. Grown fish
are frequently found at the edge, or a little
within the edge, of the loose ice, in the 79th
degree of north latitude, in the month of May;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and small whales, of different ages, at fields,
and sometimes in bays of the ice, in the 80th
degree. Usually the fish are most plentiful in
June, and, on some occasions, they are met
with in every degree of latitude from 75° to 80°.
In this month, the large whales are found in
every variety of situation; sometimes in open
water, at others in the loose ice, or at the edges
of fields and floes, near the main impervious
body of ice, extending towards the coast of
West Greenland. The smaller animals of the
species are, at the same time, found further to
the south than in the spring, at floes, fields, or
even among loose ice, but most plentifully
about fields or floes, at the border of the main
western ice, in the latitude of 78° or 78½°. In
July, the fishery generally terminates, sometimes
at the beginning of the month, at others,
though more rarely, it continues throughout
the greater part of it. Few small fish are seen
at this season.</p>

<p>The parallel of 78° to 78½° is, on the whole,
the most productive fishing-station. The interval
between this parallel and 80°, or any
other situation more remote, is called the
“northward,” and any situation in a lower
latitude than 78° is called the “southward.”
Though the 79th degree affords whales in the
greatest abundance, yet the 76th degree affords
them, perhaps, more generally. In this latter
situation a very large kind of the mysticetus
is commonly to be found, throughout the season,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
from April to July inclusive. Their number,
however, is not often great; and as the situation
in which they occur is unsheltered, and,
consequently, exposed to heavy swells, the
southern fishery is not much frequented. The
parallel of 77° to 77½° is considered a “dead
latitude” by the fishers, but occasionally it
affords whales also.</p>

<p>From an attentive observation of facts, it
would appear that various tribes of the mysticetus
inhabit different regions, and pursue
various routes on their removal from the
places where first seen. These tribes seem
to be distinguished by a difference of age or
manners, and, in some instances, apparently
by one of species or subspecies. The systematical
movements of the whales receive
illustration from many well-known facts.
Sometimes a large tribe, passing from one place
to another, which, under such circumstances,
is denominated a “run of fish,” has been traced
in its movements, in a direct line from the
south towards the north, along the seaward
edge of the western ice, through a space of two
or three degrees of latitude; then it has been
ascertained to have entered the ice, and penetrated
to the northward beyond the reach of the
fishers. In certain years, it is curious to observe,
that the whales commence a simultaneous
retreat throughout the whole fishing limits, and
all disappear within the space of a very few days.</p>

<p>Having now mentioned, generally, the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
places resorted to by the whales in the
Spitzbergen seas, it will, possibly, be interesting
to such as are in any way concerned in the
fishery, to notice more distinctly their favourite
haunts under particular circumstances.</p>

<p>Experience proves that the whale has its
favourite places of resort, depending on a sufficiency
of food, particular circumstances of
weather, and particular portions and qualities
of the ice. Thus, though many whales may
have been seen in open water when the weather
was fine, after the occurrence of a storm perhaps
not one is to be seen; and, though fields
are sometimes the resort of hundreds of whales,
yet, whenever the loose ice around separates
entirely away, the whales quit them also.
Hence, fields seldom afford whales in much
abundance, excepting at the time when they
first “break out,” and become accessible; that
is, immediately after a vacancy is made on
some side by the separation of adjoining fields,
floes, or drift-ice. Whales are rarely seen in
abundance in the large open spaces of water
which sometimes occur amidst fields and floes,
nor are they commonly seen in a very open
pack, unless it be in the immediate neighbourhood
of the main western ice. They seem to
have a preference for close packs and patches
of ice, and for fields under certain circumstances;
for deep bays, or <em>bights</em>, and sometimes
for clear water situations; occasionally for detached
streams of drift-ice, and most generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
for extensive sheets of bay-ice. Bay-ice is a
favourite retreat of the whales, so long as it
continues sufficiently tender to be conveniently
broken for the purpose of respiration. In such
situations, whales may frequently be seen in
amazing numbers, elevating and breaking the
ice with their crowns, the eminences on their
heads in which their blow-holes are situated.</p>

<p>The most favourable opportunity for prosecuting
the fishery commonly occurs with north,
north-west, or west winds. At such times, the
sea near the ice is almost always smooth, and
the atmosphere, though cloudy and dark, is
generally free from fog or thick snow. The
fishers prefer a cloudy to a clear sky, because,
in very bright weather, the sea becomes illuminated,
and the shadows of the whale-boats
are so deeply impressed in the water by the
beams of the sun, that the whales are very apt
to take the alarm, and evade the utmost care
and skill of their pursuers. South-east or east
winds, though disagreeable, cause a violent
agitation of the pieces of ice, and so annoy the
whales as to induce them to leave their retreat
and appear in the open sea. Although the
fishery requires a cloudy atmosphere, yet it
must be free from fog or continued snow;
smooth water, with a breeze of wind, and navigably
open, or perfectly solid ice.</p>

<p>The boats and principal instruments employed
in the capture of the whale next claim
a description. Whale-boats are, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
peculiarly adapted for the occupation they are
intended to be employed in. A well-constructed
Greenland boat possesses the following properties:—It
floats lightly and safely on the water,
is capable of being rowed with great speed, and
readily turned round; it is of such capacity,
that it carries six or seven men, seven or eight
hundred weight of whale-line, and various
other materials, and yet retains the necessary
properties of safety, buoyancy, and speed,
either in smooth water, or where it is exposed
to a considerable sea. Whale-boats, being very
liable to receive damage, both from whales and
ice, are always carver-built—a structure which
is easily repaired. They are usually of the
following dimensions. Those called six-oared
boats, adapted for carrying seven men, six of
whom, including the harpooner, are rowers, are
generally twenty-six to twenty-eight feet in
length, and about five feet nine inches in
breadth. Six-men boats, that is, with five
rowers and a steersman, are usually twenty-five
to twenty-six feet in length, and about five feet
three inches in breadth; and four-oared boats
are usually twenty-three to twenty-four feet in
length, and about five feet, three inches in
breadth. The main breadth of the two first
classes of boats is at about three-sevenths
of the length of the boat, reckoned from
the stern; but in the last class it is necessary
to have the main breadth within one-third
of the length of the boat from the stern.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
The object of this is to enable the smaller boat
to support, without being dragged under water,
as great a strain on the lines as those of a larger
class; otherwise, if such a boat were sent out by
itself, its lines would be always liable to be lost
before any assistance could reach it.</p>

<p>The five-oared or six-men boat is that which
is in general use; though each fishing-ship generally
carries one or two of the largest class.
These boats are now commonly built of fir
boards, one-half or three-fourths of an inch
thick, with timbers, keel, gunwales, stern, and
stern-post of oak. An improvement in the
timbering of whale-boats has lately been made,
by sawing the timber out of very straight
grained oak, and bending them to the required
form after being made supple by the
application of steam, or immersion in boiling
water. This improvement, which renders the
timbers more elastic than when they are sawn
out of crooked oak, and at the same time
makes the boat stronger and lighter, was
suggested by Thomas Brodrick, esq., of Whitby,
ship-builder. Though the principle has long
been acted upon in clincher-built boats, with ash
timbers, the application to carver-built whale-boats
is, I believe, new. The bow and stern of
Greenland boats are both sharp, and in appearance
very similar, but the stern forms a
more acute angle than the bow. The keel has
some depression in the middle from which the
facility of turning is acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>The instruments of general use in the capture
of the whale are the harpoon and the
lance. The harpoon is an instrument of iron, of
about three feet in length. It consists of three
conjoined parts, called the “socket,” “shank,”
and “mouth,” the latter of which includes the
barbs or “withers.” This instrument, if we
except a small addition to the barbs and some
enlargement of dimensions, maintains the same
form in which it was originally used in the
fishery two centuries ago. At that time, the
mouth or barbed extremity was of a triangular
shape, united at the shank in the middle of one
of the sides, and this being scooped out on each
side of the shank formed two simple flat barbs.
In the course of last century, an improvement
was made by adding another small barb, resembling
the beard of a fishhook, within each of
the former withers in a reverse position. The
two principal withers in the present improved
harpoon measure about eight inches in length
and six in breadth, the shank is eighteen inches
to two feet in length, and four-tenths of an inch
in diameter, and the socket, which is hollow,
swells from the size of the shank to near two
inches diameter, and is about six inches in
length. Now, when the harpoon is forced by a
blow into the fat of the whale, and the line is
held tight, the principal withers seize the strong
ligamentous fibres of the blubber, and prevent it
from being withdrawn; and, in the event of its
being pulled out so far as to remain entangled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
by one wither only, which is frequently the
case, then the little reversed barb, or “stop-wither,”
as it is called, collecting a number of
the same reticulated sinewy fibres, which are
very numerous near the skin, prevents the harpoon
from being shaken out by the ordinary
motions of the whale. The point and exterior
edges of the barbs of the harpoon are sharpened
to a rough edge by means of a file. This part
of the harpoon is not formed of steel, as it is
frequently represented, but of common soft iron,
so that when blunted it can be readily sharpened
by a file, or even by scraping it with a
knife.</p>

<p>The most important part in the construction
of this instrument is the shank. As this part
is liable to be forcibly and suddenly extended,
twisted, and bent, it requires to be made of the
softest and most pliable iron. That kind which
is of the most approved tenacity is made of old
horse-shoe nails or <em>stubs</em>, which are formed into
small rods, and two or three of these welded
together, so that should a flaw happen to occur
in any one of the rods, the strength of the whole
might still be depended on. Some manufacturers
inclose a quantity of stub-iron in a
cylinder of best foreign iron, and form the
shank of the harpoon out of a single rod. A
test, sometimes used for trying the sufficiency
of a harpoon, is to wind its shank round a bolt
of inch-iron, in the form of a close spiral, then
to unwind it again, and put it into a straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
form. It bears this without injury in the
cold state, it is considered as excellent. The
breaking of a harpoon is of no less importance
than the value of a whale, which is sometimes
estimated at more than £1000 sterling. This
consideration has induced many ingenious persons
to turn their attention towards improving
the construction and security of this instrument,
but though various alterations have been suggested,
such as forming the shank of wire,
adding one or two lateral barbs, etc., etc., they
have all given place to the simplicity of the
ancient harpoon.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the harpoon is the
lance, which is a spear of iron of the length of
six feet. It consists of a hollow socket, six
inches long, swelling from half an inch, the
size of the shank, to near two inches in diameter,
into which is fitted a four feet stock or
handle of fir; a shank, five feet long and half
an inch in diameter; and a mouth of steel,
which is made very thin, and exceedingly
sharp, seven or eight inches in length, and two
or two and a half in breadth. Besides these
instruments, there is also the harpoon gun. It
was invented in the year 1731, and used by
some individuals with success. Being however
difficult, and somewhat dangerous in its application,
it was laid aside for many years. In
1771 or 1772, a new one was produced to the
Society of Arts, and received as an original
invention. Between 1772 and 1792, the Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
expended large sums in premiums to whale-fishers
and to artisans for improvements in the
gun and harpoon. Since 1792, they have generally
been in the habit of offering a premium
of ten guineas to the harpooner who should
shoot the greatest number of whales in one
season, not being less than three. This premium,
however, though it has been frequently offered,
has been seldom claimed. In its present improved
form, as made by Mr. Wallis, gunsmith,
Hull, the harpoon-gun consists of a kind of
swivel, having a barrel of wrought-iron 24 or
26 inches in length, of 3 inches exterior diameter,
and 1⅞ inches bore. It is furnished with two
locks, which act simultaneously, for the purpose
of diminishing the liability of the gun missing
fire. The shank of the harpoon is double,
terminating in a cylindrical knob, fitting the
bore of the gun. Between the two parts of the
shank is a wire ring, to which is attached the
line. Now, when the harpoon is introduced
into the barrel of the gun, the ring with the
attached line remains on the outside near the
mouth of the harpoon, but the instant that it is
fired, the ring flies back against the cylindrical
knob. The harpoon-gun has been rendered
capable of throwing a harpoon near forty yards
with effect, yet, on account of the difficulty
in the management of it, it has not been very
generally adopted.</p>

<p>In the course of the outward passage, the
different utensils are fitted for immediate use.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
One preparation is that which is known by the
name of “spanning harpoons.” A piece of rope,
of the best hemp, called a “fore-ganger,” about
two and a quarter inches in circumference, and
eight or nine yards in length, is spliced closely
round the shank of the harpoon, the swelled
socket of which prevents the eye of the <em>splice</em>
from being drawn off. A stock, or handle, six
or seven feet in length, is then fitted into the
socket, and fastened in its place through the
medium of the fore-ganger. The fastening of
the stock is sufficient only for retaining it firm
in its situation during the discharge of the weapon,
but is liable to be disengaged soon afterwards;
on which the harpoon, relieved from
the shake and twist of this no longer necessary
appendage, maintains its hold with better effect.
After the stock drops out, it is seldom lost, but
still hangs on the line by means of a loop of
cord, fixed openly round it, for the purpose of
preventing the stock from floating away. Every
harpoon is stamped with the name of the ship to
which it belongs; and when prepared for use,
a private mark, containing the name of the ship
and master, with the date of the year written
upon leather, is concealed beneath some rope-yarns,
wound round the socket of the instrument,
and the same is sometimes introduced
also into the fore-ganger. These marks serve
to identify the harpoons, when any dispute happens
to arise relative to the claims of different
ships to the same fish and have sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
proved of essential service in deciding cases
which might otherwise have extended to vexatious
litigations.</p>

<p>A harpoon thus prepared, with fore-ganger
and stock, is said to be “spanned in.” In this
state, the point or mouth, being very clean and
sharp, is preserved in the same condition by
a shield of oiled paper or canvas; and the instrument,
with its appendages, laid up in a
convenient place, ready for being attached to
the whale-line in a boat when wanted.</p>

<p>The principal preparations for commencing the
fishery are included in the “fitting of the boats.”
In this work all the people belonging to the ship
are employed. The boats are first cleared of all
lumber, and then the whale-lines, each consisting
of 120 fathoms of rope, about two and a quarter
inches in circumference, are spliced to each
other, to the amount of about six to each boat,
the united length of which is about 720 fathoms,
or 4,320 feet; and the whole carefully and beautifully
coiled in compartments in the boat prepared
for the purpose. A portion of five or six
fathoms of the line first put into the boat, called
the “stray-line,” is left uncovered by that which
follows, and coiled by itself in a small compartment
at the stern of the boat: it is furnished
with a loop or “eye,” for the facility of connecting
the lines of one boat with those of another.
To the upper end of the line is spliced the fore-ganger
of a spanned harpoon, thus connecting
the harpoon with all the lines in the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Every boat completely fitted is furnished with
two harpoons (one spare,) six or eight lances,
and five to seven oars, together with the following
instruments and apparatus:—A “jack,” or
flag, fastened to a pole, intended to be displayed
as a signal, whenever a whale is harpooned; a
“tail-knife,” used for perforating the fins or tail
of a dead whale; a “mik,” or rest, made of
wood, for supporting the stock of the harpoon
when ready for instant service; an “axe,” for
cutting the line when necessary; a “pigging,”
or small bucket, for bailing the boat or wetting
the running lines; a “snatch-block;” a “grapnel;”
two “boat-hooks;” a “fid;” a wooden
“mallet,” and “snow-shovel;” also, a small
broom and a “swab,” together with spare tholes,
grommets, etc. In addition to these, the two
six-oared or other swiftest boats are likewise
furnished with an apparatus, called a “winch,”
for heaving the lines into the boat after the fish
is either killed or has made his escape; and in
some ships they also carry a harpoon-gun, and
apparatus for loading. The whole of the articles
above enumerated are disposed in convenient
places throughout the boat. The axe is
always placed within the reach of the harpooner,
who, in case of an accident, can cut the line in
an instant; the harpoon-gun is fixed by its
swivel to the boat’s stern; the lances are laid in
the sides of the boat, upon the thwarts; the
hand-harpoon is placed upon the mik, or rest,
with its stock, and on the bow of the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
with its point, and the fore-ganger is clearly
coiled beneath it, so that the harpoon can be
taken up and discharged in a moment. An oar
is used for steering, in preference to a rudder,
in consequence of its possessing many advantages:
an oar does not retard the velocity of the
boat so much as a rudder; it is capable of turning
the boat when in a state of rest, and more
readily than a rudder when in motion; and it
can be used for propelling the boat in narrow
places of the ice, where the rowers cannot ply
their oars, by the process of sculling, and in
calms for approaching a whale without noise,
by the same operation.</p>

<p>The crew of a whale-ship are separated into
divisions, equal in number to the number of
the boats. Each division, consisting of a harpooner,
a boat-steerer, and a line-manager, together
with three or four rowers, constitutes a
boat’s crew. The harpooner’s principal office
is, as his name implies, to strike the whale, also
to guide the line, or to kill an entangled whale
with his lances. When in pursuit he rows the
bow-oar. He has the command of the boat.
The boat-steerer ranks next to the harpooner;
he guides the course of the boat, watches the
motions of the whale pursued, intimates its
movements to the harpooner, and stimulates the
crew to exertion by encouraging exclamations.
The line-manager rows the “after-oar” in the
boat, and, conjointly with the boat-steerer, attends
to the lines when in the act of running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
out or coiling in. The remainder of the crew
pull the oars. Besides these divisions of the
seamen of a whaler into boats’ crews, they are
classed on the passages, and when no whale-fishing
is going on, as in other vessels, into watches.</p>

<p>On fishing-stations, when the weather is
such as to render the fishery practicable, the
boats are always ready for instant service, suspended
from davits, or cranes, by the sides of
the ship, and furnished with stores, as before
enumerated; two boats at least, the crews of
which are always in readiness, can in general
be manned and lowered into the water within
the space of one minute of time. “Wherever
there is a probability of seeing whales, when
the weather and situation are such as to present
a possibility of capturing them, the “crow’s
nest” is generally occupied by the master, or
some one of the officers, who, commanding
from thence an extensive prospect of the surrounding
sea, keeps an anxious watch for the
appearance of a whale. Assisted by a telescope,
he views the operations of any ship
which may be in sight at a distance; and
occasionally sweeps the horizon with his glass,
to extend the limited sphere of vision in which
he is able to discriminate a whale with the
naked eye to an area vastly greater. The
moment that a fish is seen, he gives notice to
the “watch upon deck,” part of whom leap into
a boat, are lowered down, and push off towards
the place. If the fish be large, a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
boat is immediately dispatched to the support
of the other. When the whale again appears,
two boats row towards it with their utmost
speed, and though they may be disappointed in
all their attempts, they generally continue the
pursuit until the fish either takes the alarm
and escapes, or they are recalled by a signal
to the ship. When two or more fishes appear
at the same time in different situations, the
number of boats sent in pursuit is commonly
increased. When the whole of the boats are
sent out, the ship is said to have “a loose fall.”
During fine weather, when there is great probability
of finding whales, a boat is generally
kept in readiness, manned and afloat, sometimes
towed by a rope astern, or, if the ship be
still, at a little distance. There are several
rules observed in approaching a whale, as precautions,
to prevent the animal from taking
the alarm. As the whale is dull of hearing,
but quick of sight, the boat-steerer always endeavours
to get behind it, and, in accomplishing
this, he sometimes takes a circuitous route.
In calm weather, when guns are not used, the
greatest caution is necessary before a whale
can be reached; smooth careful rowing is
always requisite, and sometimes sculling.</p>

<p>When it is known that a whale seldom abides
longer on the surface of the water than two
minutes, that it generally remains from five to
ten or fifteen minutes under water, that in
this interval it sometimes moves through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
space of half a mile or more, and that the
fisher has very rarely any certain intimation of
the place in which it will reappear—the difficulty
and address requisite to approach sufficiently
near, during its short stay on the surface,
to harpoon it, will be readily appreciated.
It is, therefore, a primary consideration with
the harpooner always to place his boat as near
as possible to the spot where he expects the
fish to rise; and he considers himself successful
in the attempt when the fish “comes up
within a start,” that is, within the distance of
about two hundred yards. A whale moving
forward, at a small distance beneath the surface
of the sea, leaves a sure indication of its situation
in what is called “an eddy,” having somewhat
the resemblance of “the wake,” or track
of a ship; and in fine calm weather, its change
of position is sometimes pointed out by the
birds, many of which closely follow it when at
the surface, and hover over it when below,
whose keener vision can discern it when it is
totally concealed from human eye. By these
indications many whales have been taken.</p>

<p>The providence of God is manifested in the
tameness and timidity of many of the largest
inhabitants of the earth and sea, whereby they
fall victims to the prowess of man, and are
rendered subservient to his convenience in life.
And this was the design of the lower animals
in their creation, for God, when he made
man, gave him “dominion over the fish of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth.” The holy psalmist, when considering
the power and goodness of God in the creation,
exclaimed, “What is man, that thou art mindful
of him; and the son of man, that thou
visitest him?” And, in contemplation of the
glory and honour put upon man by the Almighty,
in the power given him over created
nature, he adds, “Thou madest him to have
dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast
put all things under his feet: ... the fowl of
the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
passeth through the paths of the seas. O Lord
our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the
earth!” Hence, while we admire the cool and
determined intrepidity of those who successfully
encounter the huge mysticetus, if we are led to
reflect on the source of the power by which
the strength of men is rendered effectual for
the mighty undertaking, our reflections must
lead us to the great First Cause as the only
source from whence such power could be derived.
If there be peril in the encounter between
man and God’s most powerful creatures,
how much more dangerous must be the struggle
between man and the Lord his Maker; and
how certain, if it be prolonged, the terrible
issue of such a contest! The power of the
mighty monster of the deep, or even of the
most glorious archangel, is as nothing in comparison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
with Him to whom power belongeth,
and who will overwhelm his adversaries with a
fearful and final perdition. Now, however,
there is no fury in him, and he is as condescending
as he is powerful, entreating his rebellious
subjects to receive the peace of his
reconciliation, and to draw near to him with a
penitent and contrite heart, through the merit
and intercession of his Son, in whom he
assures us of a free and complete forgiveness.</p>

<p>Whenever a whale lies on the surface of the
water, unconscious of the approach of its enemies,
the hardy fisher rows directly upon it;
and, an instant before the boat touches it, buries
his harpoon in its back; but if, while the boat
is at a little distance, the whale should indicate
its intention of diving, by lifting its head above
its common level, and then plunging it under
water, and raising its body till it appears like a
large segment of a sphere, the harpoon is thrown
from the hand, or fired from a gun, the former
of which methods, when skilfully practised, is
efficient at the distance of eight or ten yards,
and the latter at the distance of thirty yards, or
upward. The wounded whale, in the surprise
and agony of the moment, makes a convulsive
effort to escape. Then is the moment of danger.
The boat is subjected to the most violent blows
from its head or its fins, but particularly from
its ponderous tail, which sometimes sweeps the
air with such tremendous fury, that both boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
and men are exposed to one common destruction.</p>

<p>The head of the whale is avoided, because it
cannot be penetrated with the harpoon; but
any part of the body between the head and the
tail will admit of the full length of the instrument,
without danger of obstruction. The moment
that the wounded whale disappears, or leaves
the boat, a jack or flag, elevated on a staff, is
displayed, on sight of which those on watch in
the ship give the alarm, by stamping on the
deck, accompanied by a simultaneous and continuous
shout of “a fall.” This word, derived
from the Dutch language, is expressive of the
conduct of the sailors in jumping, dropping,
falling to man the boats on an occasion requiring
extreme dispatch. At this sound, the sleeping
crew arouse, jump from their beds, rush upon
deck, with their clothes tied by a string in their
hands, and crowd into the boats. With a temperature
of zero, should a “fall” occur, the
crew would appear on deck, shielded only by
their drawers, stockings, and shirts, or other
habiliments in which they sleep. They generally
contrive to dress themselves in part, at
least, as the boats are lowered down, but sometimes
they push off in the state in which they
rise from their beds, row away towards the
“fast-boat,” and have no opportunity of clothing
themselves for a length of time afterwards. The
alarm of “a fall” has a singular effect on the
feelings of a sleeping person unaccustomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the whale-fishing business. It has often been
mistaken as a cry of distress. A landsman in
a Hull ship, seeing the crew on an occasion of
a fall rush upon deck, with their clothes in
their hands, and leap into the boats, when there
was no appearance of danger, thought the men
were all mad; but with another individual the
effect was totally different. Alarmed with the
extraordinary noise, and still more so when he
reached the deck with the appearance of all the
crew seated in the boats in their shirts, he
imagined the ship was sinking. He therefore
endeavoured to get into a boat himself; but
every one of them being fully manned, he was
always repulsed. After several fruitless endeavours
to gain a place among his comrades, he
cried out, with feelings of evident distress,
“What shall I do?—will none of you take
me in?”</p>

<p>The first effort of a “fast-fish,” or whale that
has been struck, is to escape from the boat by
sinking under water. After this, it pursues its
course directly downward, or reappears at a
little distance, and swims with great celerity
near the surface of the water towards any
neighbouring ice among which it may obtain an
imaginary shelter; or it returns instantly to
the surface, and gives evidence of its agony by
the most convulsive throes, in which its fins
and tail are alternately displayed in the air and
dashed into the water with tremendous violence.
The former behaviour, however, that is, to dive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
towards the bottom of the sea, is so frequent in
comparison of any other, that it may be considered
as the general conduct of a “fast-fish.”
A whale, struck near the edge of any large sheet
of ice, and passing underneath it, will sometimes
run the whole of the line out of one boat in the
space of eight or ten minutes of time. To retard,
therefore, as much as possible, the flight
of the whale, and to secure the lines, it is usual
for the harpooner to cast one, two, or more
turns of the line round a kind of post, called a
<em>bollard</em>, which is fixed within ten or twelve
inches of the stern of the boat for the purpose.
Such is the friction of the line, when running
round the bollard, that it frequently envelopes
the harpooner in smoke; and if the wood were
not repeatedly wetted, would probably set fire
to the boat.</p>

<p>During the capture of one whale, a groove is
sometimes cut in the bollard, near an inch in
depth, and were it not for a plate of brass, iron,
or a block of lignum vitæ, which covers the top
of the stern, where the line passes over, it is
apprehended that the action of the line on the
material of the boat would cut it down to the
water’s edge in the course of one season of successful
fishing. The approaching distress of a
boat for want of line is indicated by the elevation
of an oar in the way of a mast, to which is
added a second, a third, or even a fourth, in
proportion to the nature of the exigence. The
utmost care and attention are requisite on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
part of every person in the boat when the lines
are running out, fatal consequences having been
sometimes produced by the most trifling neglect.
On my first voyage to the whale-fishery, such
an accident occurred. A thousand fathoms of
line were already out, and the fast-boat was
forcibly pressed against the side of a piece of
ice. The harpooner, in his anxiety to retard
the flight of the whale, applied too many turns
of the line round the bollard, which, getting entangled,
drew the boat beneath the ice. Another
boat providentially was at hand, into
which the crew, including myself, who happened
to be present, had just time to escape.
The whale, with near two miles length of line,
was, in consequence of the accident, lost.</p>

<p>When fish have been struck by myself, I
have, on different occasions, estimated their rate
of descent. For the first 300 fathoms, the average
velocity was usually after the rate of eight to
ten miles per hour. In one instance, the third
line of 120 fathoms was run out in sixty-one
seconds, that is, at the rate of 8·16 miles, or 7·18
nautical miles, per hour. The average stay
under water of a wounded whale, which steadily
descends after being struck, according to the
most usual conduct of the animal, is about thirty
minutes. The longest stay I ever observed was
fifty-six minutes; but in shallow water I have
been informed it has sometimes been known to
remain an hour and a half at the bottom after
being struck, and yet has returned to the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
alive. The greater the velocity, the more
considerable the distance to which it descends,
and the longer the time it remains under water,
so much greater in proportion is the extent of
exhaustion, and the consequent facility of accomplishing
its capture. Immediately that it
reappears, the assisting boats make for the
place with their utmost speed, and as they
reach it, each harpooner plunges his harpoon
into its back, to the amount of three, four,
or more, according to the size of the whale
and the nature of the situation. Most frequently,
however, it descends for a few minutes after receiving
the second harpoon, and obliges the
other boats to await its return to the surface
before any attack can be made. It is afterwards
actively plied with lances, which are
thrust into its body, aiming at its vitals. At
length, when exhausted by numerous wounds
and the loss of blood, which flows from the
huge animal in copious streams, it indicates
the approach of its dissolution by discharging
from its “blow-holes” a mixture of blood
along with the air and mucus which it usually
expires, and finally jets of blood. The sea to
a great extent around is dyed with its blood,
and the ice-boats and men are sometimes
drenched with the same. Its track is likewise
marked by a broad pellicle of oil, which exudes
from his wounds, and appears on the surface
of the sea. Its final capture is sometimes preceded
by a convulsive and energetic struggle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
in which its tail, reared, whirled, and violently
jerked in the air, resounds to the distance of
miles. In dying, it turns on its back, or on its
side, which joyful circumstance is announced
by the capturers with the striking of their
flags, accompanied with three lively huzzas.</p>

<p>The remarkable exhaustion observed on the
first appearance of a wounded whale at the
surface, after a descent of 700 or 800 fathoms
perpendicular, does not depend on the nature
of the wound it has received, for a hundred
superficial wounds received from harpoons could
not have the effect of a single lance penetrating
the vitals, but is the effect of the almost incredible
pressure to which the animal must
have been exposed. The surface of the body
of a large whale may be considered as comprising
an area of 1,540 square feet. This,
under the common weight of the atmosphere
alone, must sustain a pressure of 3,104,640 lbs.,
or 1,386 tons. But at the depth of 800 fathoms,
where there is a column of water equal in
weight to about 154 atmospheres, the pressure
on the animal must be equal to 211,200 tons.
This is a degree of pressure of which we can
have but an imperfect conception. It may
assist our comprehension, however, to be informed,
that it exceeds in weight sixty of the
largest ships of the British navy, when manned,
provisioned, and fitted for a six months’ cruise.</p>

<p>By the motions of the fast-boat, the movements
of the whale are estimated. Every fast-boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
carries a flag, and the ship to which such
boats belong also wears a flag, until the whale
is either killed or makes its escape. These
signals serve to indicate to surrounding ships
the exclusive title of the fast-ship to the entangled
whale, and to prevent their interference,
excepting in the way of assistance in
the capture.</p>

<p>With respect to the length of time requisite
for capturing a whale, it may be remarked
that this greatly depends on the activity of
the harpooners, the favourableness of situation
and weather, and on the peculiar conduct of
the whale attacked. I have myself witnessed
the capture of a large whale in twenty-eight
minutes, and have also been engaged with
another fish, which was lost, after it had been
entangled about sixteen hours. Under the
most favourable circumstances, the average
length of time occupied in the capture of a
whale may be stated as not exceeding an
hour, and the general average, including all
sizes of fish and all circumstances of capture,
may probably be two or three hours. The
mode described in the preceding pages of
conducting the fishery for whales under favourable
circumstances, may be considered as the
general plan pursued by the fishers of all
ports of Britain, as well as of those of other
nations who resort to Spitzbergen.</p>

<p>The ease with which some whales are subdued,
and the slightness of the entanglement by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
which they are taken, are truly surprising; but,
with others, it is equally astonishing, that neither
line nor harpoon, nor any number of each,
is sufficiently strong to effect their capture.
Whales have even been taken in consequence
of the entanglement of a line, without any harpoon
at all; though, when such a case has
occurred, it has evidently been the result of accident.
A harpooner belonging to the Prince
of Brazils, of Hull, had struck a small fish. It
descended, and remained for some time quiet,
and at length appeared to be drowned. The
strain on the line being then considerable, it
was taken to the ship’s capstern, with a view
of heaving the fish up. The force requisite for
performing this operation was extremely various;
sometimes the line came in with ease, at
others, a quantity was withdrawn with great
force and rapidity. As such, it appeared evident
that the fish was yet alive. The heaving,
however, was persisted in, and after the greater
part of the lines had been drawn on board, a
dead fish appeared at the surface, secured by
several turns of the line round its body. It
was disentangled with difficulty, and was confidently
believed to be the whale that had been
struck. But when the line was cleared from
the fish, it proved to be merely the “bight,”
for the end still hung perpendicularly downward.
What was then the surprise to find
that it was still pulled away with considerable
force! The capstern was again resorted to, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
shortly afterwards they hove up, also dead, the
fish originally struck, with the harpoon still
fast. Hence, it appeared that the fish first
drawn up had got accidentally entangled with
the line, and, in its struggles to escape, had still
further involved itself, by winding the line repeatedly
round its body. The fish first entangled,
as was suspected, had long been dead, but
it was this interloper that occasioned the jerks
and other singular effects observed on the
line.</p>

<p>The method already described is that which
is adopted for the capture of whales under the
most favourable circumstances, and is subject
to many alterations when the situation or circumstances
are peculiar. Hence arise various
modes of capturing the whale, which furnish
abundant opportunities for the exercise of ingenuity
and skill, and are attended by their
peculiar dangers. To an enumeration of these
various methods, according to local circumstances,
we now proceed to direct the reader’s
attention.</p>

<p>1. <em>Pack-fishing.</em>—The borders of close packs
of drift-ice are frequently a favourite resort of
large whales. To attack them in such a situation
subjects the fisher to great risks in his
lines and boats, as well as uncertainty in effecting
their capture. When a considerable swell
prevails on the borders of the ice, the whales,
on being struck, will sometimes recede from the
pack, and become the prize of their assailers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
but most generally they flee to it for shelter,
and frequently make their escape. To guard
against the loss of lines as much as possible, it
is usual either to strike two harpoons from
different boats at the same moment, or to
bridle the lines of a second boat upon those of
the boat from which the fish is struck. This
operation consists in fixing other lines to those
of the fast-boat, at some distance from the harpoon,
so that there is only one harpoon and one
line immediately attached to the fish, but the
double strength of a line from the place of their
junction to the boats. Hence, should the fish
flee directly into the ice, and proceed to an inaccessible
distance, the two boats bearing an
equal strain on each of their lines can at pleasure
draw the harpoon, or break the single part
of the line immediately connected with it, and
in either case secure themselves against any
considerable loss.</p>

<p>When a pack, from its closeness, prevents
boats from penetrating, the men travel over the
ice, leaping from piece to piece, in pursuit
of the entangled whale. In this pursuit they
carry lances with them, and sometimes harpoons,
with which, whenever they can approach
the fish, they attack it; and if they succeed in
killing it, they drag it towards the exterior
margin of the ice, by means of the line fastened
to the harpoon with which it was originally
struck. In such cases, it is generally an object
of importance to sink it beneath the ice; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
effecting which purpose, each lobe of the tail is
divided from the body, excepting a small portion
of the edge, from which it hangs pendulous
in the water. If it still floats, bags of sand,
kedges, or small cannon, are suspended by a
block on the bight of the line, wherewith the
buoyancy of the dead whale is usually overcome.
It then sinks, and is easily hauled out
by the line into the open sea.</p>

<p>To particularize all the variety of pack-fishing,
arising from wind and weather, size of
the fish, state and peculiarities of the ice, etc.,
would require more space than the interest of
the subject to general readers would justify. I
shall therefore only remark, that pack-fishing
is, on the whole, the most troublesome and dangerous
of all others; that instances have occurred
of fish having been entangled during
forty or fifty hours, and escaped after all; and
that other instances are remembered, of ships
having lost the greater part of their stock
of lines, several of their boats, and sometimes,
though happily less commonly, some individuals
of their crews.</p>

<p>2. <em>Field-fishing.</em>—The fishery for whales,
when conducted at the margin of those wonderful
sheets of solid ice, called fields, is, when
the weather is fine, and the refuge for ships
secure, the most agreeable, and sometimes the
most productive of all situations which the
fishery of Greenland presents. A fish struck
at the margin of a large field of ice generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
descends obliquely beneath it, takes four or
eight lines from the fast-boat, and then returns
exhausted to the edge. It is then attacked in
the usual way with harpoons and lances, and is
easily killed. There is one evident advantage
in field-fishing, which is this: when the fast-boat
lies at the edge of a firm unbroken field,
and the line proceeds in an angle beneath the
ice, the fish must necessarily arise somewhere
in a semicircle described from the fast-boat as
a centre, with a sweep not exceeding the length
of the lines out; but most generally it appears
in a line extending along the margin of the ice,
so that the boats, when dispersed along the
edge of the field, are as effectual and as ready
for promoting the capture as twice the number
of boats or more when fishing in open situations;
because, in open situations, the whale
may arise anywhere within a circle, instead of
a semicircle, described by the length of the
lines withdrawn from the fast-boat, whence it
frequently happens that all the attendant boats
are disposed in a wrong direction, and the fish
recovers its breath, breaks loose, and escapes
before any of them can secure it with a second
harpoon. Hence, when a ship fishes at a field
with an ordinary crew and six or seven boats,
two of the largest fish may be struck at the
same time with every prospect of success;
while the same force attempting the capture of
two at once in an open situation, will not unfrequently
occasion the loss of both. There have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
indeed, been many instances of a ship’s crew,
with seven boats, striking at a field six fish at
the same time, and succeeding in killing the
whole; generally speaking, six boats at a field
are capable of performing the same execution
as near twice that number in open situations.
Besides, fields sometimes afford an opportunity
of fishing, when in any other situation there can
be little or no probability of success, or, indeed,
when to fish elsewhere is utterly impracticable.
Thus, calms, storms, and fogs, are great annoyances
in the fishery in general, and frequently
prevent it altogether, but at fields the fishery
goes on under any of these disadvantages. As
there are several important advantages attending
the fishery at fields, so likewise there are
some serious disadvantages, chiefly relating to
the safety of the ships engaged in the occupation.
The motions of fields are rapid, various,
and unaccountable, and the power with which
they approach each other, and squeeze every
resisting object, immense; hence occasionally
vast mischief is produced, which it is not
always in the power of the most skilful and
attentive master to foresee or prevent.</p>

<p>Such are the principal advantages and disadvantages
of fields of ice to the whale-fishery.
The advantages, however, as above enumerated,
though they extend to large floes, do not
extend to small floes, or to such fields, how
large soever they may be, as contain cracks or
holes, or are filled up with thin ice in the interior.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Large and firm fields are the most convenient,
and likewise the most advantageous
for the fishery; the most convenient, because
the whales, unable to breathe beneath a close
extensive field of ice, are obliged to make their
appearance again above water among the boats
on the look out; and they are the most advantageous,
because not only the most fish commonly
resort to them, but a greater number
can be killed with less force, and in a shorter
space of time, than in any other situation.
Thin fields, or fields full of holes, being by no
means advantageous to fish by, are usually
avoided, because a “fast fish” retreating under
such a field, can respire through the holes in
the centre as conveniently as on the exterior;
and a large fish usually proceeds from one hole
to another, and if determined to advance, cannot
possibly be stopped. In this case, all that
can be done is, to break the line or draw the
harpoon out. But when the fish can be
observed blowing in any of the holes in a field,
the men travel over the ice, and attack it with
lances, pricking it over the nose to endeavour
to turn it back. This scheme, however, does
not always answer the expectations of the
fishers, as frequently the fear of his enemies
acts so powerfully on the whale that he pushes
forward towards the interior to his dying
moment. When killed, the same means are
used as in pack-fishing to sink it, but they
do not always succeed; for the harpoon is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
frequently drawn out, or the line broken in the
effort. If, therefore, no attempt to sink the
fish avails, there is scarcely any other practicable
method of making a prize of it, (unless
when the ice happens to be so thin that it can
be broken with a boat, or a channel readily
cut in it with an ice-saw,) than cutting the
blubber away, and dragging it piece by piece
across the ice to the vessel, which requires immense
labour, and is attended with vast loss of
time. Hence we have a sufficient reason for
avoiding such situations, whenever fish can be
found elsewhere.</p>

<p>As connected with this subject, I cannot pass
over a circumstance which occurred within my
own observation, and which excited my highest
admiration. On the 8th July, 1813, the ship Esk
lay by the edge of a thin sheet of ice, in which
were several thin parts and some holes. Here a
fish being heard blowing, a harpoon, having a
line connected with it, was conveyed across the
ice by a boat on guard, and the harpooner succeeded
in striking the whale, at the distance of
350 yards from the verge. It dragged out ten
lines, (2,400 yards,) and was supposed to be seen
blowing in different holes in the ice. After
some time, it happened to make its appearance
on the exterior, when a harpoon was struck at
the moment it was on the point of proceeding
again beneath. About a hundred yards
from the edge, it broke the ice where it was a
foot in thickness with its crown, and respired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
through the opening. It then determinately
pushed forward, breaking the ice as it advanced,
in spite of the lances continually directed against
it. It reached at length a kind of basin in the
field, where it floated on the surface of the
water without any encumbrance from ice. Its
back being fairly exposed, the harpoon struck
from the boat was observed to be so slightly
entangled that it was ready to drop out. Some
of the officers lamented this circumstance, and
expressed a wish that the harpoon were better
fast, observing at the same time that if it
should slip out, the fish would either be lost, or
they would be under the necessity of flensing it
where it lay, and of dragging the pieces of
blubber over the ice to the ship, a kind and
degree of labour every one was anxious to
avoid. No sooner was the wish expressed, and
its importance made known, than one of the
sailors, a smart and enterprising fellow, stepped
forward and volunteered his services to strike
it better in. Not at all intimidated by the
surprise which was manifested in every countenance
by such a bold proposal, he pulled out
his pocket-knife, leapt upon the back of the
living whale, and immediately cut the harpoon
out. Stimulated by this courageous example,
two of his companions proceeded to his assistance.
While one of them hauled upon the line,
and held it in his hands, the other set his
shoulder against the extremity of the harpoon,
and, though it was without a stock, he contrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
to strike it again into the fish more
effectually than it was at first. The fish was
in motion before this was finished. After they
got off its back, it advanced a considerable
distance, breaking the ice all the way, and survived
this uncommon treatment ten or fifteen
minutes. This admirable act was an essential
benefit. The fish sunk spontaneously after
being killed, on which it was hauled out to
the edge of the ice by the line, and secured
without further trouble. It proved a stout
whale, and a very acceptable prize.</p>

<p>When a ship approaches a considerable field
of ice, and finds whales, it is usual to moor to
the leeward side of it, from which the adjoining
ice generally first separates. Boats are then
placed on watch on each side of the ship, and
stationed at intervals of one hundred or one
hundred and fifty yards along the edge of the
ice. Hence, if a fish arises anywhere between
the extreme boats, it seldom escapes
unhurt. It is not uncommon for a great
number of ships to moor to the same sheet
of ice. When the whale-fishery of the
Hollanders was in a flourishing state, above
one hundred sail of ships might sometimes be
seen moored to the same field of ice, each
having two or more boats on watch. The field
would in consequence, be so nearly surrounded
with boats, that it was almost impossible for a
fish to rise near the verge of the ice without
being within the limits of a start of some of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>3. <em>Fishing in crowded ice or in open packs.</em>—In
navigable open drift-ice, or amongst small
detached streams and patches, either of which
serve in a degree to break the force of the sea,
and to prevent any considerable swell from
arising, we have a situation which is considered
as one of the best possible for conducting the
fishery in; consequently, it comes under the
same denomination as those favourable situations
in which I have first attempted to
describe the proceedings of the fishers in killing
the whale. But the situation I now mean to
refer to is when the ice is crowded and nearly
close, so close, indeed, that it scarcely affords
room for boats to pass through it, and by no
means sufficient space for a ship to be navigated
among it. This kind of situation occurs
in somewhat open packs, or in large patches of
crowded ice, and affords a fair probability of
capturing a whale, though it is seldom accomplished
without a considerable deal of trouble.
When the ice is very crowded, and the ship
cannot sail into it with propriety, it is usual,
especially with foreigners, to seek out for a mooring
to some mass of ice, if such can be found, extending
two or three fathoms or more under
water. A piece of ice of this kind is capable not
only of holding the ship “head to wind,” but also
to windward of the smaller ice. The boats then
set out in chase of any fish which may be seen,
and when one happens to be struck, they proceed
in the capture in a similar manner as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
when under more favourable circumstances,
excepting so far as the obstruction which the
quality and arrangement of the ice may offer
to the regular system of proceeding. Among
crowded ice, for instance, the precise direction
pursued by the fish is not easily ascertained,
nor can the fish itself be readily discovered on
its first arrival at the surface after being struck,
on account of the elevation of the intervening
masses of ice, and the great quantity of line it
frequently takes from the fast-boat. Success
in such a situation depends on the boats being
spread widely abroad, and on a judicious arrangement
of each boat; on a keen look out on
the part of the harpooners in the boats, and on
their occasionally taking the benefit of a hummock
of ice, from the elevation of which the
fish may sometimes be seen blowing in the interstices
of the ice; on pushing or rowing the
boats with the greatest imaginable celerity
towards the place where the fish may have
been seen; and lastly, on the exercise of the
highest degree of activity and dispatch in every
proceeding.</p>

<p>If these be neglected, the fish will generally
have taken breath, recovered its strength, and
removed to some other quarter, before the arrival
of the boats; and it is often remarked,
that if there be one part of the ice more
crowded or more difficult of access than
another, it commonly retreats thither for refuge.
In such cases, the sailors find much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
difficulty in getting to it with their boats,
having to separate many pieces of ice before
they can pass through between them. But
when it is not practicable to move the pieces,
and when they cannot travel over them, they
must either drag the boats across the intermediate
ice, or perform an extensive circuit
before they can reach the opposite side of the
close ice, into which the whale has retreated.</p>

<p>A second harpoon in this case, as indeed in
all others, is a material point. They proceed
to lance whenever the second harpoon is struck,
and strike more harpoons as the auxiliary
boats progressively arrive at the place. When
the fish is killed, it is often at a distance from
the ship, and so circumstanced that the ship
cannot get near it. In such cases, the fish must
be towed by the boats to the ship; an operation
which, among crowded ice, is most troublesome
and laborious.</p>

<p>4. <em>Bay-ice fishing.</em>—Bay-ice constitutes a
situation which, though not particularly dangerous,
is yet, on the whole, one of the most
troublesome in which whales are killed. In
sheets of bay-ice, the whales find a very effectual
shelter; for so long as the ice will not
carry a man, they cannot be approached with a
boat without producing such a noise as must
certainly warn them of the intended assault;
and if a whale, by some favourable accident,
were struck, the difficulties of completing the
capture are always numerous, and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
prove insurmountable. The whale having free
locomotion beneath the ice, the fishers pursue it
under great disadvantage. The fishers cannot
push their boats toward it but with extreme
difficulty, while the whale, invariably warned
by the noise of their approach, possesses every
facility for avoiding its enemies.</p>

<p>In the year 1813, I adopted a new plan of
fishing in bay-ice, which was attended with the
most successful result. The ship under my
command, the Esk, of Whitby, was frozen into
a sheet of bay-ice, included in a triangular
space, formed by several massive fields and
floes. Here a number of small whales were
seen sporting around us in every little hole or
space in the bay-ice, and occasionally they were
observed to break through it for the purpose of
breathing. In various little openings free of
ice near the ship, few of which were twenty
yards in diameter, we placed boats, each equipped
with a harpoon and lines, and directed by
two or three men. They had orders to place
themselves in such a situation that if a fish
appeared in the same opening they could
scarcely fail of striking it. Previous to this, I
supplied myself with a pair of ice-shoes, consisting
of two pieces of thin deal, six feet in
length, and seven inches in breadth. They were
made very thin at both ends, and in the centre
of each was a hollow place, exactly adapted for
the reception of the sole of my boot, with a
loop of leather for confining the toes. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
thus enabled to retain the ice-shoes pretty
firmly to my feet when required, or, when I
wished it, to disengage them in a moment.
Where the ice was smooth, it was easy to move
in a straight line, but in turning I found a
considerable difficulty, and required some practice
before I could effect it without falling. I
advanced with tolerable speed, where the ice
was level on the surface, by sliding the shoes
alternately forward, but when I met with rough
hilly places I experienced great inconvenience.
When, however, the rough places happened to
consist of strong ice, which generally was the
case, I stept out of my ice-shoes until I reached
a weaker part. Equipped with this apparatus,
I travelled safely over ice which had not been
frozen above twenty-four hours, and which was
incapable of supporting the weight of the
smallest boy in the ship.</p>

<p>Whenever a fish was struck, I gave orders to
the harpooner, in running the line, to use every
means of drowning it; the trouble of hauling it
up, under the circumstances in which the ship
was placed, being a matter of no consideration.
This was attempted by holding a steady tight
strain on the line, without slacking it or jerking
it unnecessarily, and by forbearing to haul the
line when the fish stopped. By this measure,
one fish, the stoutest of the three which we got,
was drowned. When others were struck, and
the attempt to drown them failed, I provided
myself with a harpoon, and observing the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
of the line, travelled towards the place
where I expected the fish to rise. A small boat
was launched, more leisurely, in the same direction
for my support; and whenever the ice
in my track was capable of supporting a man,
assistance was afforded me in dragging the line.
When the wounded fish appeared, I struck my
harpoon through the ice, and then, with some
occasional assistance, proceeded to lance it, until
it was killed. At different times, the fish rose
beneath my feet, and broke the ice on which I
stood; on one occasion, where the ice was happily
more than usually strong, I was obliged to
leave my ice shoes, and skip off. In this way
we captured three fish, and took their produce
on board, while several ships near us made not
the least progress in the fishery. After they
were killed, we had much trouble in getting
them to the ship, but as we could not employ
ourselves to advantage in any other way, we
were well satisfied with the issue. This part of
the business I could not effect alone, and all
hands, who were occasionally employed in it,
broke through the ice. Some individuals broke
in two or three times, but no serious accident
ensued. As a precaution, we extended a rope
from man to man, which was held in the hands
of each in their progress across the ice, and
which served for drawing those out of the water
who happened to break through. Sometimes
ten or a dozen of them would break in at once,
but so far was such an occurrence from exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
distress, that each of their companions indulged
a laugh at their expense, notwithstanding they
probably shared the same fate a minute or two
afterwards.</p>

<p>5. <em>Fishing in storms.</em>—Excepting in situations
sheltered from the ice, it would be alike useless
and presumptuous to attempt to kill whales during
a storm. Instances, however, occur, wherein
fish that were struck during fine weather, or in
winds which do not prevent the boats from plying
about, remain entangled, but unsubdued, after
the commencement of a storm. Sometimes the
capture is completed, at others the fishers are
under the necessity of cutting the lines, and
allowing the whale to escape. Sometimes, when
they have succeeded in killing it, and in securing
it during the gale with a hawser to the ship,
they are enabled to make a prize of it on the
return of moderate weather; at others, after
having it to appearance secured by means of a
sufficient rope, the dangerous proximity of an ice-pack
constrains them to cut it adrift and abandon
it for the preservation of their vessel. After
thus being abandoned, it becomes the prize of
the first who gets possession of it, though it be
in the face of the original capturers. A storm
commencing while the boats are engaged with
an entangled fish, sometimes occasions serious
disasters. Generally, however, though they
suffer the loss of the fish, and perhaps some of
their boats and materials, yet the men escape
with their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>6. <em>Fishing in foggy weather.</em>—The fishery
in storms can never be voluntary; but in foggy
weather, though occasionally attended with
hazard, the fishery is not altogether impracticable.
The fogs which occur in the icy
regions in June and July are generally dense
and lasting: they are so thick, that objects
cannot be distinguished at the distance of 100
or 150 yards, and frequently continue for
several days without attenuation. To fish with
safety and success, during a thick fog, is, therefore,
a matter of difficulty, and of still greater
uncertainty. When it happens that a fish
conducts itself favourably, that is, descends
almost perpendicularly, and, on its return to
the surface, remains nearly stationary, or moves
round in a small circle, the capture is usually
accomplished without hazard or particular
difficulty; but when, on the contrary, it proceeds
with any considerable velocity in a horizontal
direction, or obliquely downwards, it
soon drags the boats out of sight of the ship,
and shortly so confounds the fishers in the intensity
of the mist, that they lose all traces of
the situation of their vessel. If the fish, in its
flight, draws them beyond the reach of the
sound of a bell, or a horn, their personal safety
becomes endangered; and if they are removed
beyond the sound of cannon, their situation
becomes extremely hazardous, especially if no
other ships happen to be in the immediate
vicinity. Meanwhile, whatever may be their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
imaginary or real danger, the mind of their
commander must be kept in the most anxious
suspense until they are found; and whether
they may be in safety or near perishing with
fatigue, hunger, and cold, so long as he is uncertain
of their fate, his anxiety must be the
same.</p>

<p>Before entering on the subsequent operations
of the whalers, connected with a successful
fishery, I shall give a few examples of remarkable
strength, activity, or other peculiarity, in
the behaviour of whales after they have been
struck, being a few of the curious circumstances
connected with the fishery which I have myself
observed, or have received from unquestionable
authority. On the 25th June, 1812, one of
the harpooners belonging to the Resolution, of
Whitby, under my command, struck a whale
by the edge of a small floe of ice; assistance
being promptly afforded, a second boat’s lines
were attached to those of the fast-boat in a few
minutes after the harpoon was discharged;
the remainder of the boats proceeded to some
distance in the direction which the fish seemed
to have taken. In about a quarter of an hour,
the fast-boat, to my surprise, again made a
signal for lines. As the ship was then within
five minutes’ sail, we instantly steered towards
the boat, with the view of affording assistance
by means of a spare boat we still retained on
board. Before we reached the place, however,
we observed four oars displayed in signal order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
which, by their number, indicated a most
urgent necessity for assistance. Two or three
men were at the same time seen seated close by
the stern, which was considerably elevated, for
the purpose of keeping it down, while the bow
of the boat, by the force of the line, was drawn
down to the level of the sea, and the harpooner,
by the friction of the line round the
bollard, was enveloped in smoky obscurity.
At length, when the ship was scarcely one
hundred yards distant, we perceived preparations
for quitting the boat. The sailors’ pea
jackets were cast upon the adjoining ice; the
oars were thrown down; the crew leaped overboard;
the bow of the boat was buried in the
water; the stern rose perpendicularly, and
then majestically disappeared. The harpooner
having caused the end of the line to be fastened
to the iron ring at the boat’s stern was the
means of its loss; and a <em>tongue</em> of the ice, on
which was a depth of several feet of water,
kept the boat, by the pressure of the line
against it, at such a considerable distance as
prevented the crew from leaping upon the floe.
Some of them were, therefore, put to the necessity
of swimming for their preservation, but
all of them succeeded in scrambling upon the
ice, and were taken on board the ship in a few
minutes. It may be here observed, that it is an
uncommon circumstance for a fish to require
more than two boats’ lines in such a situation;
none of our harpooners, therefore, had any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
scruple in leaving the fast-boat, never suspecting,
after it had received the assistance of one
boat with six lines, or upward, that it would
need any more.</p>

<p>Several ships being about us, there was a
possibility that some person might attack and
make a prize of the whale, when it had so far
escaped us that we no longer retained any hold
of it; as such, we set all sail the ship could
safely sustain, and worked through several
narrow and intricate channels in the ice in the
direction I observed the fish had retreated.
After a little time, it was descried by the people
in the boats at a considerable distance to the
eastward; a general chase immediately commenced,
and within the space of an hour three
harpoons were struck. We now imagined
that the fish was secure, but our expectations
were premature. The whale resolutely pushed
beneath a large floe that had been recently
broken to pieces by the swell, and soon drew
all the lines out of the second fast-boat, the
officer of which, not being able to get any assistance,
tied the end of his line to a hummock of
ice and broke it. Soon afterwards, the other
two boats, still <em>fast</em>, were dragged against the
broken floe, when one of the harpoons drew
out. The lines of only one boat, therefore
remained fast to the fish, and this, with six or
eight lines out, was dragged forward into the
shattered floe with astonishing force; pieces of
ice, each of which were sufficiently large to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
have answered the purpose of a mooring for the
ship, were wheeled about by the strength of the
whale; and such was the tension and elasticity
of the line that, whenever it slipped clear of
any mass of ice, after turning it round into the
space between any two adjoining pieces, the
boat and its crew flew forward through the
crack with the velocity of an arrow, and never
failed to launch several feet upon the first mass
of ice that it encountered.</p>

<p>While we scoured the sea around the broken
floe of the ship, and while the ice was attempted
in vain by the boats, the whale continued to
press forward in an easterly direction towards
the sea. At length, when fourteen lines, about
1,680 fathoms, were drawn from the fourth fast-boat,
a slight entanglement of the line broke it
at the stern. The fish again made its escape,
taking along with it a boat and twenty-eight
lines. The united length of the lines was 6,720
yards, or upwards of three English miles and
three-quarters; value with the boat above £150
sterling. The obstruction of the sunken boat to
the progress of the fish must have been immense,
and that of the lines likewise considerable,
the weight of the lines alone being thirty-five
hundred weight. So long as the fourth fast-boat,
through the medium of its lines, retained
its hold of the fish, we searched the adjoining
sea with the ship in vain, but in a short time
after the line was divided we got sight of the
object of pursuit at the distance of near two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
miles to the eastward of the ice and boats, in
the open sea. One boat only with lines, and
two empty boats, were reserved by the ship.
Having, however, happily fine weather and a
breeze of wind, we immediately gave chase
under all sails, though it must be confessed
with the insignificant force by us, the distance
of the fish, and the rapidity of its flight considered,
we had but very small hopes of success.
At length, after pursuing it five or six miles,
being at least nine miles from the place where
it was struck, we came up with it, and it
seemed inclined to rest after its extraordinary
exertion. The two dismantled or empty boats
having been furnished with two lines each, (a
very inadequate supply,) they, together with
the one in good state of equipment, now made
an attack upon the whale. One of the harpooners
made a blunder; the fish saw the boat,
took the alarm, and again fled. I now supposed
it would be seen no more; nevertheless, we
chased nearly a mile in the direction I imagined
it had taken, and placed the boats to the
best of my judgment in the most advantageous
situations. In this instance we were extremely
successful. The fish rose near one of
the boats, and was immediately harpooned. In
a few minutes, two more harpoons entered its
back, and lances were plied against it with
vigour and success. Exhausted by its amazing
exertions to escape, it yielded itself at length to
its fate, received the piercing wounds of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
lances without resistance, and finally died without
a struggle. After all, it may seem surprising
that it was not a particularly large individual,
the largest lamina of whalebone only measuring
nine feet six inches, while those affording
twelve feet bone are not uncommon. The
quantity of line withdrawn from the different
boats engaged in the capture was singularly
great. It amounted altogether to 10,440 yards,
or nearly six English miles. Of these, thirteen
new lines were lost, together with the sunken
boat, the harpoon connecting them with the fish
having dropped out before the whale was killed.
Thus terminated with success an attack upon a
whale, which exhibited the most uncommon
determination to escape from its pursuers,
seconded by the most amazing strength, of any
individual whose capture I ever witnessed.</p>

<p>When engaged in the pursuit of a large
whale, it is a necessary precaution for two
boats at all times to proceed in company, that
the one may be able to assist the other on any
emergency. With this principle in view, two
boats from the Esk were sent out in chase of
some large whales, on the 13th of June, 1814.
No ice was within sight, the boats had proceeded
some time together, when they separated in
pursuit of two whales, not far distant from
each other, when, by a singular coincidence, the
harpooners each struck his fish at the same
moment. They were a mile from the ship.
Urgent signals for assistance were immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
displayed by each boat, and, in a few minutes,
one of the harpooners was under the necessity
of slipping the end of his line. Happily, the
other fish did not descend so deep, and the
lines in the boat proved adequate to the occasion.
One of the fish being then supposed
to be lost, five of the boats, out of seven, attended
on the fish which yet remained entangled,
and speedily killed it. A short time
afterwards, the other fish supposed to be irrecoverably
lost, was descried at a little distance
from the place where it was struck; three boats
proceeded against it; it was immediately struck,
and in twenty minutes also killed. Thus were
successfully captured two whales, both of which
had been despaired of. They produced us near
forty tuns of oil, value at that time £1,400.
The lines attached to the fish last killed were
recovered in a remarkable manner. The harpooners
were busily engaged in attempting to
secure them, when the harpoon, by which alone
they were prevented from sinking, slipped out;
but as it descended in the water, it luckily
hooked the line belonging to another boat, by
which both harpoon and lines were preserved.</p>

<p>It is very generally believed by the whalers,
that fish have occasionally been struck, which,
by sudden extension or heave of the body,
have instantly disengaged themselves from the
harpoon. This usually happens when the
whale is struck “with a slack back,” as that
position of the fish is denominated, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the back being depressed the flesh is relaxed.
A harpoon then struck occasions an uncommon
wound. Hence, if the fish suddenly extends itself
and elevates its back, the wound appears of twice
the size of the harpoon, and consequently the
weapon is capable of being thrown out by the
jerk of the body. Under such circumstances
as these, a large whale was struck by a harpooner
belonging to the ship Howe, of Shields.
The fish extending and lifting its back with
uncommon violence, the harpoon was disengaged
and projected high into the air, when, at the same
moment, the fish rolled over upon its back, and
received the point of the falling weapon in its
belly, whereby it was captured and caught.
This circumstance, romantic as it may appear,
is so well authenticated by the person who
struck the fish, together with others who were
in the boat at the same time, and were witnesses
of the fact, that I have no scruple in
introducing it here.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May, 1817, the Royal Bounty,
of Leith, captain Drysdale, fell in with a great
number of whales, in the lat. 77° 25′ north, and
long. 5° or 6° east. Neither ice nor land was in
sight, nor was there supposed to be either the
one or the other within fifty or sixty miles.
A brisk breeze of wind prevailed, and the
weather was clear. The boats were, therefore,
manned and sent in pursuit. After a chase
of about five hours, the harpooner, commanding
a boat, who, with another in company, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
rowed out of sight of the ship, struck one of the
whales. This was about four <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, of the 29th.
The captain, supposing from the long absence of
the two most distant boats that a fish had been
struck, directed the course of the ship towards
the place where he had last seen them, and
about eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> he got sight of a boat which
displayed the signal for being <em>fast</em>. Some time
afterwards, he observed the other boat approach
the fish, a second harpoon struck, and the usual
signal displayed. As, however, the fish dragged
the two boats away with considerable speed, it
was midday before any assistance could reach
them. Two more harpoons were then struck,
but such was the vigour of the whale that,
although it constantly dragged through the
water four to six boats, together with a length
of 1,600 fathoms of line which it had drawn
out of the different boats, yet it pursued its
flight nearly as fast as a boat could row and
such was the terror that it manifested on the
approach of its enemies, that, whenever a boat
passed beyond its tail, it invariably dived. All
their endeavours to lance it were, therefore, in
vain.</p>

<p>The crews of the loose boats being unable to
keep pace with the fish, caught hold of and
moored themselves to the fast-boats; and for
some hours afterwards, all hands were constrained
to sit in idle impatience, waiting for some
relaxation in the speed of the whale. Its most
general course had hitherto been to windward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
but a favourable change taking place, enabled
the ship, which had previously been at a great
distance, to join the boats at eight <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> They
succeeded in tacking one of the lines to the
ship which was fast to the fish, with a view of
retarding its flight. They then furled the top-gallant
sails, and lowered the top sails; but
after supporting the ship a few minutes head to
wind, the wither of the harpoon upset or twisted
aside, and the instrument was disengaged from
its grasp. The whale immediately set off to
windward with increased speed, and it required
an interval of three hours before the ship could
again approach it. Another line was then
taken on board, which immediately broke. A
fifth harpoon had previously been struck, to
replace the one which had been pulled out, but
the line attached to it was soon afterwards cut.
They then instituted various schemes for arresting
the speed of the fish, which occupied
their close attention nearly two hours. But its
velocity was yet such that the master, who had
himself proceeded to the attack, was unable to
approach sufficiently near to strike a harpoon.
After a long chase, however, he succeeded in
getting hold of one of the lines which the fish
dragged after it, and in fastening another line
to it. The fish then happily turned towards
the ship, which was a considerable distance to
leeward.</p>

<p>At four <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of the 30th, thirty-six hours after
the fish had been struck, the ship again joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the boats, when, by a successful manœuvre, they
secured two of the fast lines on board. The
wind blowing a moderately brisk breeze, the
top-gallant sails were taken in, the courses
hauled up, and the top sails clewed down, but,
notwithstanding the resistance a ship thus situated
must necessarily offer, she was towed by the
fish directly to windward with the velocity of at
least one-half to two knots during an hour and
a half; and then, though the whale must have
been greatly exhausted, it beat the water with
its fins and tail in so tremendous a way, that the
sea around was in a continual foam, and the
most hardy of the sailors scarcely dared to approach
it. At length, about eight <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, after forty
hours of almost incessant, and for the most
part fruitless exertion, this formidable and astonishing
animal was killed. The capture and
the flensing occupied forty-eight hours. The
fish was eleven feet four inches in bone, (the
length of the longest lamina of whalebone,) and
its produce filled forty-seven butts, or twenty-three
and a half tun casks, with blubber.</p>

<p>I proceed now to enumerate the proceedings
of the fishers after a whale is killed. Some
preliminary measures are requisite before a
whale can be flensed. The first operation performed
on a dead whale is to lash it with a
rope, passed several times through two holes
pierced through the tail to the bow of the boat.
The more difficult operation of freeing the
whale from the entanglement of the line is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
then attempted. As the whale, when dead, always
lies on its back or on its side, the lines
and harpoons are generally far under water.
When they are seen passing obliquely downwards,
they are hooked with a grapnel, pulled
to the surface, and cut. But, when they hang
perpendicular, or when they cannot be seen,
they are discovered by a process called “sweeping
a fish.” This is performed by taking a
part of a whale-line in two different boats, ten
or fifteen fathoms asunder, and while one boat
lies at rest, supporting the end of a line, the
other is rowed round the fish, and the bight or
intermediate part of the line allowed to sink
below the fish as it proceeds, until each of the
parts held in the two boats are again brought
together. Hence, when one part of the line
has made a circuit of the fish, it must evidently
inclose every other line or appendage affixed
to it. Thus inclosed, they are pulled up to
the surface of the water, and each of them cut
at the splice of the fore-ganger, leaving the
harpoon sticking in the fish, with its fore-ganger
attached, and allowing the end of the
line to sink, and be hauled on board of the boat
from whence it was withdrawn at the convenience
of the crew. While this is in progress,
the men of other boats, having first lashed the
tail to a boat, are employed in lashing the fins
together across the belly of the whale.</p>

<p>On one occasion I was myself engaged in the
capture of a fish, upon which, when to appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
dead, I leaped, cut holes in the fins, and
was in the act of “reeving” a rope through
them to lash them together, when the fish sank
beneath my feet. As soon as I observed that
the water had risen above my knees, I made a
spring towards a boat, at the distance of three
or four yards from me, and caught hold of the
gunwale. Scarcely was I helped on board,
before the fish began to move forward, turn
from its back upon its belly, reared its tail aloft,
and began to shake it with such prodigious
violence, as to resound through the air to the
distance of two or three miles. In the meanwhile
all the sailors very properly kept aloof,
and beheld its extraordinary power with the
greatest astonishment. After two or three minutes
of this violent exercise, it ceased, rolled
upon its side, and died.</p>

<p>A fish being properly secured, is then “taken
in tow;” that is, all the boats form themselves
in a line, by ropes always carried for the purpose,
and unite their efforts in rowing towards
the ship. Towing a fish is usually considered
a cheerful though laborious operation, and is
generally performed with great expressions of
joy. A large whale, by means of six boats, can
be towed at a rate of nearly a mile per hour.
The fish having reached the ship, is taken to
the larboard side, arranged and secured for
flensing. For the performance of this operation,
a variety of knives and other instruments are
requisite. Towards the stern of the ship the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
head of the fish is directed, and the tail, which
is first cut off, rests abreast of the fore-chains;
the smallest or posterior part of the whale’s
body, where the tail is united, is called the
rump, and the extremity or anterior part of the
head, the nose or nose-end. The rump, then,
supported by a tackle, is drawn forward by
means of a stout rope, called the rump-rope;
and the head is drawn in an opposite direction,
by means of the “nose-tackle.” Hence the
body of the fish is forcibly extended. The
right-side fin, being next the ship, is lashed
upwards towards the gunwale. A band of
blubber, two or three feet in width, encircling
the fish’s body, and lying between the fins and
the head, being the fat of the neck, or what
corresponds in other animals with the neck, is
called the kent, because by means of it the fish
is turned over, or kented. Now, to the commencement
of this imaginary band of fat, or
kent, is fixed the lower extremity of a combination
of powerful blocks, called the kent-purchase.
Its upper extremity is fixed round the
head of the main-mast, and its fall or rope is
applied to the windlass, drawn tight, and the
upper surface of the fish raised several inches
above the water. The enormous weight of a
whale prevents the possibility of raising it more
than one-fourth or one-fifth part out of the
water, except indeed when it has been some
days dead, in which case it swells, in consequence
of air generated by putrefaction, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
one-third of its bulk appears above the surface.
The fish then lying belly upward, extended,
and well secured, is ready for commencing the
operation of flensing. In this state a suspension
of labour is generally allowed, in which the
crew refresh themselves and prepare for the
ensuing duties.</p>

<p>An unhappy circumstance once occurred in
an interval of this kind. At that period of the
fishery, (forty or fifty years ago,) when a single
stout whale was sufficient to remunerate the
owners of a ship for the expenses of the voyage,
great joy was exhibited on the capture of a
whale by the fishers. They not only had
a dram of spirits, but were sometimes provided
with some favourite “mess,” on which
to regale themselves before they commenced
the arduous task of flensing. At such a period,
the crew of an English vessel had captured their
first whale. It was taken to the ship, placed on
the lee-side, and though the wind blew a strong
breeze, it was fastened only by a small rope
attached to the fin. In this state of supposed
security, all hands retired to regale themselves,
the captain himself not excepted. The ship
being at a distance from any ice, and the fish
believed to be secure, they made no great haste
in their enjoyment. At length, the specksioneer,
having spent sufficient time in indulgence and
equipment, with an air of importance and self-confidence,
proceeded on deck, and naturally
turned to look on the whale. To his astonishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
it was not there. In some alarm, he looked
astern, ahead, on the other side, but his search
was useless; the ship drifting fast had pressed
forcibly upon the whale, the rope broke, the
fish sank, and was lost. The mortification of
this event may be conceived, but the termination
of their vexation will not easily be imagined,
when it is known that no other opportunity
of procuring a whale occurred during
the voyage. The ship returned home clean.
The blessings of Divine Providence, of a temporal
and also of a spiritual kind, are bestowed
and continued in union with the activity and
watchfulness of those who receive them, and it
is a law of the earthly, and also of the heavenly
treasure, that “whosoever hath, to him shall
be given; and whosoever hath not, from him
shall be taken even that which he seemeth to
have.”</p>

<p>After the whale is properly secured, and the
men are sufficiently refreshed, the harpooners,
having their feet armed with “spurs,” to prevent
them from slipping, descend upon the fish.
Two boats, each of which is under the guidance
of one or two boys, attend upon them, and
serve to hold all their knives and other apparatus.
Thus provided, the harpooners, directed
by the specksioneer, divide the fat into oblong
pieces, or “slips,” by means of “blubber-spades”
and “blubber-knives;” then affixing a
“speck-tackle” to each slip, progressively flay
it off as it is drawn upward. The speck-tackles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
which are two or three in number, are rendered
effective by capsterns, winches, or other mechanical
powers. Each of them consists of a
simple combination of two single blocks, one of
which is securely fixed in a strong rope, extended
between the main-top and the fore-top,
called a guy, and the other is attached by a
strap to the blubber of the whale. The flensers
commence with the belly and under-jaw, being
the only part then above water. The blubber,
in pieces of half a ton to a ton each, is
received upon deck by the boat-steerers and
line-managers, the former with “strand-knives”
divide it into portable, cubical, or oblong
pieces, containing near a solid foot of fat,
while the latter, furnished with “pick-haaks,”
pass it between decks, down a hole in the main-hatches.
It is then received by two men styled
kings, who pack it in a receptacle provided for
it in the hold, or other suitable place, called the
flense-gut, where it remains until further convenience.</p>

<p>All the fat being taken away from the
belly, and the right fin removed, the fish is
then turned on its side, by means of the kent,
which, by the power of the windlass, readily
performs this office. The upper surface of fat
is again removed, together with the left fin, and
after a second kenting one of the “lips” is
taken away, by which the whale-bone of one
side of the head, now lying nearly horizontal,
is exposed. The fish being a little further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
turned, the whalebone of the left side is dislodged
by the use of the “bone hand-spikes,”
“bone-knives,” and “bone-spades.” Four instruments,
which, when combined, constitute
what is called the bone-geer, are used, with the
assistance of two speck-tackles, for taking up
the whalebone in one mass. On its arrival on
deck, it is split with “bone-wedges” and “junks,”
containing from five to ten blades each, and
stowed away. A further kenting brings the
fish’s back upward, and the next exposes the
second side of bone. As the fish is turned or
kented round, every part of the blubber becomes
progressively uppermost and is removed.
At length, when the whole of the blubber,
whalebone, and jawbones have been taken on
board, the kent, which now appears a slip of
perhaps thirty feet in length, is also separated,
together with the rump-rope and nose-tackle,
on which the carcase being at liberty, generally
sinks in the water and disappears. When it
floats, however, it becomes food for bears,
sharks, and various kinds of birds, all of which
attack it with the most voracious earnestness.
It is known by the name of the kreng.</p>

<p>When sharks are present, they generally
take the liberty of helping themselves very
bountifully during the progress of the flensing,
but they often pay for their temerity with their
lives. Fulmars pay close attendance in immense
numbers. They seize the fragments
occasionally disengaged by the knife while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
they are swimming in the water, but most of
the other gulls who attend on the occasion take
their share on the wing. The burgomaster is
decidedly the master of the feast. Hence, every
other bird is obliged to relinquish the most delicious
morsel when the burgomaster descends
to claim it. Bears seldom approach so near
the ship as to become partakers of the banquet.
When dispatch is seconded by ability, the operation
of flensing can be accomplished on a fish
affording from twenty to thirty tons of blubber in
the space of three or four hours, and, probably,
the average time with British fishers but little
exceeds four hours.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I was witness of a circumstance
in which a harpooner was exposed to the
most imminent risk of his life, at the conclusion
of a flensing process, by a very curious accident.
This harpooner stood on one of the jaw-bones
of a fish with a boat by his side. In this
situation, while he was in the act of cutting the
kreng adrift, a boy inadvertently struck the
point of the boat-hook, with which he usually
held the boat, through the ring of the harpooner’s
spur, and in the same act seized the
jawbone of the fish with the hook of the same
instrument. Before this was discovered, the
kreng was set at liberty, and began instantly to
sink. The harpooner then threw himself towards
the boat, but being firmly entangled by
the foot, he fell into the water. Providentially
he caught the gunwale of the boat with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
hands, but, overpowered by the force of the
sinking kreng, he was on the point of relinquishing
his grasp when some of his companions
got hold of his hands, while others threw a rope
round his body. The carcase of the fish was
suspended entirely by the poor fellow’s body,
which was, consequently, so dreadfully extended
that there was some danger of his
being drawn asunder. But such was his terror
of being taken under water, and not, indeed,
without cause, for he could never have risen
again, that, notwithstanding the excruciating
pain he suffered, he constantly cried out to his
companions to “haul away the rope.” He remained
in that dreadful state until means were
adopted for hooking the kreng with the grapnel,
and bringing it back to the surface of the water.
Had he not caught hold of the boat as he was
sinking and met with such prompt assistance,
he must infallibly have perished.</p>

<p>Next to the process of flensing is that of
making-off. When the flens-gut is filled with
blubber, or when, no fish being seen, a favourable
opportunity of leisure is presented, the operation
of making-off is generally commenced.
This consists of freeing the fat from all extraneous
substances, especially the muscular parts
and the skin, then cutting it into small pieces,
and putting it into cask through the bung-holes.
In the first instance, the ship must be moored
to a convenient piece of ice, or placed in an
open situation, and the sails so reduced as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
require no further attention in the event of bad
weather occurring. The hold of the ship must
be cleared of its superstructure of casks, until
the “ground tier,” or lowest stratum of casks is
exposed, and the ballast-water must be “started,”
or pumped out of all the casks that are removed
upon deck, as well as out of those on the ground
tier, which are first prepared for the reception
of the blubber. In “breaking out the hold,” it
is not necessary to lay open more of the ground
tier at a time than three or four casks extend in
length.</p>

<p>While the line-managers, together with the
“skee-man,” (the officer who has the direction
of operations in the hold,) the cooper,
and perhaps a few others, are employed in
breaking out the hold, the rest of the crew on
the deck arrange all the variety of apparatus
used for the preparation of the blubber before
it is put into the casks. Of this apparatus, the
most considerable part is the “speck-trough,”
with its appendages. It consists of a kind of
oblong box or chest, about twelve feet in length,
one and three quarters feet in breadth, and one
and a half feet in depth. The speck-trough is
fixed upon the deck, as nearly as possible over
the place where the casks are to be filled in the
hold. A square hole made in its bottom is
placed either over the nearest hatchway to the
scene of operations, or upon a corresponding
hole cut in the deck. The speck-trough is then
secured, and its lid turned backwards into an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
horizontal position. The surface of the lid,
forming a level table, is then covered with
blocks of whale’s-tail from end to end. This
substance makes an excellent chopping-block,
and preserves the chopping-knives from injury
when used for dividing the blubber upon it.
Into the square hole in the bottom of the speck-trough
is fitted an iron frame, to which is suspended
a canvas tube, or “hose,” denominated
a “lull.” The lull is open at both ends. Its
diameter is about a foot, and its length sufficient
to reach from the deck to the bottom of
the hold. To the middle, or towards the upper
part of the lull, is attached a “pair of nippers,”
consisting of two sticks fastened together by a
kind of hinge at one end, and capable of being
pressed together at the other. The nippers
being passed across the body of the lull, and
their detached extremities brought together,
they embrace it so closely that nothing can pass
downward while they remain in this position;
but when, on the other hand, the nippers are
extended, the lull forms a free channel of communication
between the speck-trough and the
hold.</p>

<p>Everything being in readiness, the blubber,
as it is now thrown out of the flens-gut
by the kings, undergoes the following
several operations. It is received upon deck by
the “krengers,” whose office is to remove all
the muscular parts, together with such spongy
or fibrous fat as is known by experience to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
produce very little oil. When these substances,
which go under the general denomination of
kreng, are included among the blubber in the
casks, they pass through a kind of fermentation,
and generate such a quantity of gas as sometimes
to burst the containing vessels, and occasion the
loss of their contents. From the krengers
the blubber passes to the harpooners. Each
of these officers, provided with a blubber-knife,
or a strand-knife, places himself by the side of
the “closh,” fixed in the deck. An attendant,
by means of a pair of “hand-hooks,” or a
“pick-haak,” then mounts a piece of blubber
upon the spikes of the closh, and the harpooner
slices off the skin. From the skinners, the
blubber passes into an open space, called the
bank, prepared as a depository in front of the
speck-trough, and it is then laid upon the chopping-blocks
as wanted. It now falls under the
hands of the boat-steerers, who, armed with
chopping-knives, are arranged in a line by
the side of the chopping-blocks with the speck-trough
before them. Thus prepared, they divide
the blubber, as it is placed on their blocks,
into oblong pieces, not exceeding four inches in
diameter, and push it into the speck-trough
intended for its reception. And finally, the
blubber falls under the direction of the line-managers,
stationed in the hold, who receive it
into tubs through the lull, and pass it with
their hands into the casks, through their bung-holes.
When a cask is nearly filled, the packing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
is completed by the use of a “pricker,” one
piece after another being thrust in by this instrument
until it can contain no more. It is
then securely bunged up.</p>

<p>When the ground-tier casks, as far as they
have been exposed are filled, the second-tier of
casks is stowed upon it, and likewise filled with
blubber, together with the third-tier casks when
necessary. When fish can be had in sufficiency,
the hold is filled and likewise the space between
decks. When a ship is deficient in casks,
vacancies adapted for the reception of the cargo
are filled with blubber in bulk. The operation
of making off was in the early ages of the
fishery performed on shore, and even so late as
the middle of the last century, it was customary
for ships to proceed into a harbour, and remain
while this process was going on.</p>

<p>In the Greenland whale-fishery, the importance
of a code of laws was at a very early period
apparent. A fish struck by the people of two
different ships became an object of dispute, the
first striker claiming the whole, and the second
demanding a share for his assistance. Stores
saved from wrecked vessels, and especially the
cargoes of wrecks, being objects of much moment,
were also liable to occasion disputes in a
still higher degree. Hence, about the year
1677, the Dutch issued a code of regulations,
founded on equitable principles, for the prevention
of quarrels and litigation among the fishers.
As these were found to be insufficient, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
States-General of Holland and West Friesland,
in the year 1696, approved and confirmed the
general regulations with respect to the saving
of the crews and stores of vessels wrecked in
the ice, the right to whales under peculiar circumstances,
and other matters connected with
the fishery. They consisted of twelve articles,
and every captain, specksioneer, and officer concerned
in the fishery, was obliged to subscribe
them. After being duly announced, these articles
were enforced by commissioners, chosen
from among the principal Greenland owners of
Holland, for conducting and carrying into effect
this and other matters connected with the prosperity
and regulation of the fishery.</p>

<p>Among the British whale-fishers, it does not
appear that any particular laws were ever expressly
laid down for the adjusting of differences;
yet custom has established certain
principles as constituting the rule of right, the
legality of which is sufficiently acknowledged
by their being universally respected. The fundamental
articles are two. First, that a fast
fish, or a fish in any way in possession, whether
alive or dead, is the sole and unquestionable
property of the persons so maintaining the
connection or possession; and secondly, that a
loose fish, alive or dead, is fair game. The
first of these regulations can need no modification,
but the second can only be recommended
for its simplicity and tendency to prevent litigation,
since circumstances may, and do, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
occur, in which its application is liable to
some objection. In this, as in other departments
of human conduct, it is impossible by any
strict regulations to prevent all kinds of injustice.
The highest code of human morals enjoins
on men what they shall be, as well as what
they shall do, and provides for them the one
golden precept, “Whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”
Conduct, which it is impossible to punish by
appeal to any human tribunal, is often most
fearfully in violation of this law, and must
await the decisions of that day, when God
shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</p>

<p>The following circumstance, which occurred
a good many years ago, has a tendency to
illustrate the existing Greenland laws, and to
set them in a prominent light. During a
storm of wind and snow, several ships were
beating to windward, under easy sail, along the
edge of a pack. When the storm abated and
the weather cleared, the ships steered towards
the ice. Two of the fleet approached it about
a mile asunder, abreast of each other, when the
crews of each ship accidentally got sight of a dead
fish at a little distance, within some loose ice.
Each ship now made sail to endeavour to reach
the fish before the other, which fish, being loose,
would be the prize of the first that should get
possession of it. Neither ship could outsail the
other, but each continued to press forward toward
the prize. The little advantage one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
had in distance, the other compensated with
velocity. On each bow of the two ships was
stationed a principal officer, armed with a harpoon,
in readiness to discharge. But it so
happened that the ships came in contact with
each other, when within a few yards of the fish,
and in consequence of the shock with which
their bows met, they rebounded to a considerable
distance. The officers at the same moment
discharged their harpoons, but all of
them fell short of the fish. A hardy fellow,
who was second-mate of the leeward ship,
immediately leaped overboard, and with great
dexterity swam to the whale, seized it by the
fin, and proclaimed it his prize. It was, however,
so swollen, that he was unable to climb
upon it, but was obliged to remain shivering in
the water until assistance should be sent. His
captain, elated with his good luck, forgot, or at
least neglected, his brave second-mate, and
before he thought of sending a boat to release
him from his disagreeable situation, prepared
to moor his ship to an adjoining piece of ice.
Meanwhile, the other ship tacked, and the
master himself stepped into a boat, pushed off,
and rowed deliberately towards the dead fish.
Observing the trembling seaman still in the
water, holding by the fin, he addressed him
with, “Well, my lad, you’ve got a fine fish
here,” to which, after a natural reply in the
affirmative, he added, “But don’t you find it
very cold?” “Yes,” replied the shivering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
sailor, “I’m almost starved; I wish you would
allow me to come into your boat until ours
arrive.” This favour needed no second solicitation;
the boat approached the man, and he
was assisted into it. The fish being again
loose and out of possession, the captain instantly
struck his harpoon into it, hoisted his flag, and
claimed his prize. Mortified and displeased as
the other master felt at this trick, for so it certainly
was, he had nevertheless no redress, but
was obliged to permit the fish to be taken on
board of his competitor’s ship, and to content
himself with abusing the mate for his want of
discretion, and with condemning himself for
not having more compassion on the poor fellow’s
feelings, which would have prevented the disagreeable
misadventure.</p>

<p>Success in the whale-fishery has been very
generally supposed to depend, not upon the
exercise of talent and industry on the part of
the masters and crews of the fishing-ships, but
solely upon the freaks of fortune. That the
fishery, however, is altogether a chain of casualties,
is as false as it is derogatory to the credit
of the persons employed in the enterprise.
The most skilful, from adventitious and unavoidable
circumstances, may occasionally fail, and
the unskilful may be successful; but if we mark
the average of a number of years, that is, where
the means are equal, a tolerable estimate may be
formed of the adventurer’s ability, and his fitness
for the undertaking in which he is engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>The great variety of success, which is observed
to result from the exertions of the different
Greenland commanders, when the average
of several voyages is taken, confirmed the
above position, and the circumstance of some
masters, in whatever ship they may sail, almost
always succeeding, whilst others, however favourably
circumstanced, seldom or ever procure
a whole cargo, warrants this conclusion,
that, most generally, successful fishery depends
on the experience, determined perseverance,
and personal talent of the master of the vessel,
supported by a necessary degree of skill among
the people composing his crew. There are
occasions, however, especially in those seasons
when the Greenland Seas are open, or in some
measure free from ice, in which personal talent
becomes of comparative little avail. This was
strikingly the case in the year 1817, and in some
degree in 1818. In the former season, the ice lay
at a distance so remote from Spitzbergen, that
a space of about two thousand square miles of
the surface of the sea, which is usually covered
with ice, was wholly void of it. Whatever decisions
the judicious fisher was led by experience
to form and act upon proved fallacious, and
tended only to embarrass him in all his proceedings.
The only indication which could be
of the least service to the fisher to assist him
in the choice of a situation, was the colour of
the sea. In places where the water was transparent,
and blue, or greenish blue, it was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
vain to look for whales, but in a certain stream
of cloudy water, of a deep olive-green colour, all
the whales which were seen throughout the
season, or at least nine-tenths of them, occurred,
and the chief part of those which were caught
were found in the same stream of water. This
kind of sea-water is the favourite resort of
whales during the fishing season, evidently
because it abounds with various descriptions of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actiniæ</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepiæ</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">medusæ</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cancri</i>, which constitute
the chief, if not the sole nourishment of
the whale.</p>

<p>Success in the fishery is more certain in
close than in open seasons, and has some
dependence on the suitable equipment of the
ships employed in the trade, on a sufficient
apparatus, and frequently in no inconsiderable
degree on that valuable property of the ship
called fast-sailing. When any opening occurs
in the ice of a tempting appearance, it frequently
happens that a number of ships enter
it together. The fastest sailers lead the way,
and often procure a whale or two or more before
the heavy sailing ships can perform a navigation,
and by the time the latter accomplish
it, the run of fish is frequently over. Not a
little depends in the fishery on the confidence
the sailors have in the skill of their captain,
and the efficiency of the personal talents and
exertions of their officers. If the officers are
generally unsuccessful, they are apt to lose confidence
in them, and proceed, even when good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
opportunities occur, without spirit to the attack.
The greater their spirits and confidence are,
the greater is the probability of their success.
Hence, the crew of a ship which has met with
success can generally fish better, and more
advantageously under the same circumstances,
than the people of a clean ship. For the regulation
of the ship’s movements, for the choice of
a situation, for direction in difficulties, for a
stimulus when discouraged, for encouragement
when weary, and for a variety of other important
matters, the master alone must be looked
to, on whom, indeed, almost every considerable
effort of judgment or forethought devolves.</p>

<p>I now subjoin a few instances of the dangers
which accompany the whale-fishery, most of
which presented themselves within the sphere
of my own observation. Those employed in the
occupation of killing whales are, when actually
engaged, exposed to danger from three
sources, namely, from the ice, from the climate,
and from the whales themselves. Of
these, the casualties on the ice are the most
uncommon, and the least fatal; those from
the climate the most fatal, but not the most
frequent; and the whale itself is the source
of a great proportion of the accidents which
occur.</p>

<p>The following instance illustrates the danger
from overhanging masses of ice falling on the
boats. The crew of one of the Hull whalers,
having killed a fish by the side of an iceberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
in Davis’s Strait, the fins were lashed together,
and the tail secured to a boat in the usual
way, but by the efforts only of one boat’s
crew, all the other boats belonging to the
same ship being engaged in the capture of
two more whales, neither of which were yet
subdued. This circumstance occasioned some
altercation among the crew of the boat, as to
the propriety of their remaining by the dead
whale, or of quitting it, and proceeding in an
empty boat which was at hand to the assistance
of their companions. The latter measure
was carried, but as it was deemed expedient
that one man should remain in the boat, to
which none of them would consent, they were
under the necessity of either remaining in
idleness by the fish, or leaving the fish and
the boat by themselves. But every one being
anxious to participate in the more active exercises
of the fishery, they at length agreed
unanimously to quit the boat connected with
the dead fish, and to proceed to the aid of their
comrades. The arrangements were just accomplished
in time, for they had not rowed many
fathoms from the place before a tremendous
crash of the berg ensued, an immense mass of
ice fell upon the boat they had just quitted,
and neither it nor the fish was ever seen afterwards.</p>

<p>Another danger arises from ice when boats
are inclosed and beset, and their crews prevented
from joining their ships. On June 17th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
1813, several Greenland fishing-ships penetrated
the ice into an enticing opening, in which a
number of whales were sporting in fancied security.
The John, of Greenock, Neptune, of
Aberdeen, Earl Percy, of Kirkcaldy, were immediately,
to appearance, successful. The crew
of the John in a short time killed several fish;
the people of the Neptune killed one, and struck
a second; and the crew of the Earl Percy
struck one also. Things were in this state
when I arrived in the same situation with the
Esk. My harpooners, happily as it proved, did
not succeed in any measure. The sea was as
smooth as the surface of a pond, but the ice I
observed was in a strange state of disturbance.
Some floes, and some large pieces, moved with
a velocity of three to four miles per hour, while
other similar masses were at rest. The John,
which, on her first arrival in this situation, had
navigated an open lake some leagues in circumference,
was in the space of a few hours closely
beset. The captain of the Neptune, alarmed by
the danger to which his men and boats were exposed,
left his ship to the care of his second-mate,
with eleven or twelve men, and proceeded
himself in a boat, making the fifth, to their assistance.
In a few minutes, these five boats,
together with two belonging to the Earl Percy,
were closely fixed in the ice. The ships were
forced to a distance; the ice in the course of the
following morning spread to the width of seven
or eight miles, and shortly afterwards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
people in the boats and those in the corresponding
ships lost sight of each other.</p>

<p>My father, who at this time commanded the
John, had anticipated the consequences of the
ice closing, and found refuge in a cove in an adjoining
field filled with bay-ice, into which he
thrust his ship, and obtained shelter for himself
and his comrades who were thus beset. After
three days, the ice slackened, and the Neptune
boats, together with those belonging to the Earl
Percy, left the John, although neither the sea
nor their ships were visible. In this adventure
they proved successful. When they had rowed
many hours to the south-eastward, they discovered
a ship, on their approach to which they
were invited on board, and received some
refreshment. After this, having received information
of the relative situation of their ships,
they put off, and soon after had the happiness
of regaining their respective vessels. This circumstance,
which was the occasion of so much
anxiety, danger, and loss of time to the crews
of the Neptune and Earl Percy, proved the contrary
to the people of the John, as they added
to her cargo seventeen whales, within the
space of five days, and on the sixth, the ice
having again slackened, they made their escape
into a place of safety.</p>

<p>The climate of the Polar regions becomes a
source of danger to the whale-fishers when
boats are separated from the ship to which they
belong, in foggy weather when they are overtaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
by a storm and prevented from joining
their ship, and when the people in the boats
are long exposed to inclement winds.</p>

<p>On the commencement of a heavy gale of
wind, May 11th, 1813, fourteen men put off in
a boat from the Volunteer, of Whitby, with the
view of setting an anchor in a large piece of
ice, to which it was their intention to moor the
ship. The ship approached; on a signal being
made the sails were clewed up, and a rope
fixed to the anchor, but the ice shivering with
the violence of the strain, when the ship fell
astern the anchor flew out, and the ship went
adrift. The sails being again set, the ship was
reached to the eastward, (wind at north,) the
distance of about two miles, but in attempting
to wear and return, the ship, instead of performing
the evolution, scudded a considerable
distance to leeward, and was then reached out
to sea, thus leaving fourteen of her crew to a
fate most dreadful, the fulfilment of which
seemed inevitable. The temperature of the air
was 15° or 16° of Fahrenheit, when these poor
men were left upon a detached piece of ice,
without food, without shelter from the inclement
storm, and deprived of every means of
refuge, except in a single boat, which, on account
of the number of men, and violence of the
storm, was incapable of conveying them to
their ship. Death stared them in the face
whichever way they turned, and a division in
opinion ensued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Some were wishful to remain by the ice,
but the ice could afford them no shelter from
the piercing wind, and would probably be soon
broken to pieces by the increasing swell; others
were anxious to attempt to join their ship,
while she was yet in sight, but the force of the
wind, the violence of the sea, and the smallness
of the boat in comparison of the number of men
to be conveyed, were objections which would
have appeared utterly insurmountable to any
persons but men in a state of despair. Judging
that by remaining on the ice death was but retarded
for a few hours, as the extreme cold
must eventually benumb their faculties, and
invite a sleep which would overcome the remains
of animation, they determined on making the
attempt to row to their ship. Poor creatures!
what must have been their sensations at this
moment, when the spark of hope yet remaining
was so feeble that a premature death even to
themselves seemed inevitable. They made the
daring experiment, when a few minutes’ trial
convinced them that the attempt was utterly
impracticable. They then, with longing eyes,
turned their efforts towards recovering the ice
they had left, but their utmost exertions were
unavailing. Every one now viewed his situation
as desperate, and anticipated as certain
the fatal event that was to put a period to his
life. How great must have been their delight,
and how overpowering their sensations, when,
at this most critical juncture, a ship appeared in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
sight! She was advancing directly towards
them; their voices were extended, and their flag
displayed. But although it was impossible they
should be heard, it was not impossible they
should be seen. Their flag was descried by
the people on board the ship, their courses
were so directed as to form the speediest union,
and in a few minutes they found themselves on
the deck of the Lively, of Whitby, under circumstances
of safety. They received from their
townsmen the warmest congratulations, and
while each individual was forward in contributing
his assistance towards the restoration of
their benumbed bodies, each of the rescued
appeared sensible that their narrow escape from
death was highly providential.</p>

<p>The forbearance of God is wonderful. Perhaps
these very men a few hours before were
impiously invoking their own destruction, or
venting imprecations upon their fellow-beings.
True it is, the goodness of the Almighty extendeth
over all his works, and that while
“he delighteth in mercy” he is “slow to
anger.” It is no exaggeration to affirm, that
every guilty soul of man unpardoned and
uncleansed through the blood of the Mediator,
is exposed to a peril equally portentous with
that which threatened these fishermen. God
has, however, provided an ark of mercy, floating

even now present, and entrance to it may be

relief. “Behold, now is the accepted time;

<p>One of the most calamitous events which in
modern times has occurred in the fishery, was
that which happened to the crew of the Ipswich,
captain Gordon, about fifteen years ago. A
whale was struck and killed by the Ipswich’s
people early in the spring of the year, a season
in which the weather is most uncertain. A
storm commenced, accompanied with snow,
before the capture was completed, but nevertheless
the fish was taken to the ship, and
having shelter from the ice it was flensed.
Meanwhile, four boats’ crews were employed on
a piece of ice, in hauling in the lines of the fast-boats,
etc., during the performance of which
duties the ship drifted out of sight of them.
Every effort was then made by the captain for
discovering these unhappy men, who, being
above twenty in number, constituted nearly
half of his crew. But the weather continuing
thick and stormy, and the frost most intense,
it is probable that they all perished before the
conclusion of the gale; at least none of them
were saved, nor can I learn that any of their
bodies were ever found.</p>

<p>The remarkable property of oil in smoothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the surface of the sea when considerably
agitated, and of preventing breakers in the
main ocean, was sometimes resorted to by the
ancient whale-fishers for their preservation,
when overtaken by storms at sea. It was not
unusual, I believe, a century ago, for every
whale-boat to carry along with it a keg of oil
for this very purpose; which oil, being slowly
poured overboard in a storm, afforded a sort of
defence to the boat as it drifted to leeward.
The height of the waves, it is true, is not
affected by the action of the oil, but as it intercepts
the attraction which dry air possesses for
water, it prevents the immediate action of the
wind, quells the ruffled surface of the waves,
and in a great degree prevents the tendency to
breakers, which constitutes the principal danger
in a storm.</p>

<p>The most extensive source of danger to the
whale-fisher, when actively engaged in his occupation,
arises from the object of his pursuit.
The fisher is liable to receive contusions from
oars forcibly struck by the fish, or from direct
blows from its fins or tail; he is liable to accidents
from getting entangled by the lines, or
from the boat being drawn under water by the
fish through the medium of the lines; and he
is in danger of being thrown overboard by the
heeling or jerking of the boat, or more particularly
from the boat being stove, upset, sunk, or
projected into the air, by the force of a blow
from the whale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>One of the crew of the John, of Greenock,
who was in a fast-boat in the fishery of 1818,
unfortunately slipped his foot through a coil of
line in the act of running out, which drew him
forward to the boat’s stern, and separated his
foot by the ancle. He was conveyed by the
first boat to the ship, where the assistance of
several surgeons being procured, the lower part
of the leg was cut off. After this, the poor
fellow, having received the most unremitting
attention from captain Jackson, with the best
sustenance and accommodation the ship could
afford, was restored to health, and his wound
nearly healed before the conclusion of the
voyage. It is worthy of being remarked,
that the captain and crew of the John subscribed
upwards of £24 for his relief, which
was increased by the owners of the ship and
others, on arrival, to about £37. This sum
was placed in the “Provident Bank,” at
Greenock, from whence he was permitted to
draw it, after the rate of 7<em>s.</em> per week.</p>

<p>A harpooner, belonging to the Henrietta, of
Whitby, when engaged in lancing a whale, into
which he had previously struck a harpoon,
incautiously cast a little line under his feet that
he had just hauled into the boat, after it had
been drawn out by the fish. A painful stroke
of his lance induced the whale to dart suddenly
downward, his line began to run out from
beneath his feet, and in an instant caught him
by a turn round his body. He had but just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
time to call out, “Clear away the line!”—“Oh
dear!” when he was almost cut asunder,
dragged overboard, and drowned. The line
was cut at the moment, but without avail.
The fish descended a considerable depth and
died, from whence it was drawn to the surface
by the lines connected with it, and secured.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June, 1811, a boat from the
ship Resolution, commanded at the time by
myself, put off in pursuit of a whale, and was
rowed upon its back. At the moment that it
was harpooned, it struck the side of the boat a
violent blow with its tail, the shock of which
threw the boat-steerer to some distance into the
water. A repetition of the blow projected the
harpooner and line-manager in a similar way,
and completely drenched the part of the crew
remaining in the boat with the sprays. One of
the men regained the boat, but, as the fish
immediately sank and drew the boat away
from the place, his two companions in misfortune
were soon left far beyond the reach of
assistance. The harpooner, though a practised
swimmer, felt himself so bruised and enervated
by a blow he had received on the chest, that he
was totally incapacitated from giving the least
support to his fellow-sufferer. The ship being
happily near, a boat, which had been lowered
on the first alarm, arrived to their succour at
the moment when the line-manager, who was
unacquainted with the art of swimming, was on
the point of sinking to rise no more. Both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
line-manager and harpooner were preserved;
and the fish, after a few hours’ close pursuit,
was subdued.</p>

<p>While the same ship navigated an open lake
of water in the 81° north lat., during a keen
frost and strong north wind, on the 2nd of
June, 1806, a whale appeared, and a boat put
off in pursuit. On its second visit to the surface
of the sea it was harpooned. A convulsive
heave of the tail which succeeded the wound
struck the boat at the stern, and, by its reaction,
projected the boat-steerer overboard.
As the line in a moment dragged the boat
beyond his reach, the crew threw some of
their oars towards him for his support, one of
which he happily seized. The ships and boats
being at a considerable distance, and the fast-boat
being rapidly drawn away from him, the
harpooner cut the line, with the view of rescuing
him from his dangerous situation. But no
sooner was this act performed than, to their
extreme mortification, they discovered, in consequence
of some oars being thrown towards
their floating comrades, and others being broken
or unshipped by the blow from the fish, one
oar only remained, with which, owing to the
force of the wind, they tried in vain to approach
him. A considerable period elapsed before any
boat from the ship could afford him assistance,
though the men strained every nerve for the
purpose. At length, when they reached him,
he was found with his arms stretched over an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
oar, almost deprived of sensation. On his
arrival at the ship he was in a deplorable condition.
His clothes were frozen like mail,
and his hair constituted a helmet of ice. He
was immediately conveyed into the cabin,
his clothes taken off, his limbs and body
dried and well rubbed, and a cordial administered
to him. A dry shirt and stockings
were then put upon him, and he was laid in
the captain’s bed. After a few hours’ sleep, he
awoke, and appeared considerably relieved.
He complained of a painful sensation of cold.
He was therefore removed to his own berth,
and one of his messmates ordered to lie on each
side of him, whereby the diminished circulation
of the blood was accelerated, and the animal
heat restored. The shock on his constitution,
however, was greater than was anticipated. He
recovered in the course of a few days so as to
be able to engage in his ordinary pursuits, but
many months elapsed before his countenance
exhibited its wonted appearance of health.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of the power which
the whale possesses in its tail was exhibited
within my own observation, in the year 1807.
On the 29th of May, a whale was harpooned
by an officer belonging to the Resolution. It
descended a considerable depth, and on its reappearance
evidenced an uncommon degree of
irritation. It made such a display of its fins
and tail, that few of the crew were hardy enough
to approach it. The captain, (my father,)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
observing their timidity, called a boat, and
himself struck the second harpoon. Another
boat immediately followed, and, unhappily, advanced
too far. The tail was again reared
into the air in a terrific attitude. The impending
blow was evident. The harpooner,
who was directly underneath, leaped overboard.
At the next moment, the threatened stroke was
impressed on the centre of the boat, which
buried it in the water. Happily no one was
injured. The harpooner, who leaped overboard,
escaped certain death by the act, the tail having
struck the very spot on which he stood. The
effects of the blow were astonishing. The keel
was broken, the gunwales and every plank,
excepting two, were cut through, and it was
evident the boat would have been completely
divided had not the tail struck directly upon
a coil of lines. The boat was rendered useless.</p>

<p>The Dutch ship, Gort-Moolen, commanded
by Cornelius Gerard Ouwekaas, with a cargo
of seven fish, was anchored in Greenland, in
the year 1660. The captain, perceiving a
whale ahead of his ship, beckoned his attendants,
and threw himself into a boat. He was
the first to approach the whale, and succeeded
in harpooning it before the arrival of
the second boat, which was on the advance.
Jacques Vienkes, who had the direction of it,
joined his captain immediately afterwards, and
prepared to make a second attack on the fish
when it should remount to the surface. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the moment of its ascension, the boat of Vienkes
happening unhappily to be perpendicularly
above it, was so suddenly and forcibly lifted up
by a stroke of the head of the whale, that it
was dashed to pieces before the harpooner could
discharge his weapon. Vienkes flew along
with the pieces of the boat, and fell upon the
back of the animal. This intrepid seaman,
who still retained his weapon in his grasp,
harpooned the whale on which he stood, and by
means of the harpoon and the line, which he
never abandoned, he steadied himself firmly
upon the fish, notwithstanding his hazardous
situation, and regardless of a considerable
wound that he received in his leg, in his fall
along with the fragments of the boat. All the
efforts of the other boats to approach the whale
and deliver the harpooner were futile. The
captain, not seeing any other method of
saving his companion, who was in some
way entangled with the line, called to him to
cut it with his knife, and betake himself to
swimming. Vienkes, embarrassed and disconcerted
as he was, tried in vain to follow this
counsel. His knife was in the pocket of his
drawers, and, being unable to support himself
with one hand, he could not get it out. The
whale meanwhile continued advancing along
the surface of the water with great rapidity,
but happily never attempted to dive. While
his comrades despaired of his life, the harpoon
by which he held at length disengaged itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
from the body of the whale. Vienkes, being
then liberated, did not fail to take advantage of
this circumstance. He cast himself into the
sea, and, by swimming, endeavoured to regain
the boats which continued the pursuit of the
whale. When his shipmates perceived him
struggling with the waves, they redoubled their
exertions. They reached him just as his
strength was exhausted, and had the happiness
of rescuing this adventurous harpooner from
his perilous situation.</p>

<p>In one of my earliest voyages to the whale-fishery,
I observed a circumstance which excited
my highest astonishment. One of our harpooners
had struck a whale; it dived, and all
the assisting boats had collected round the fast-boat
before it rose to the surface. The first
boat which approached it advanced incautiously
upon it. It rose with unexpected violence
beneath the boat, and projected it and all
its crew to the height of some yards in the air.
It fell on its side, upset, and cast all the men
into the water. One man received a severe
blow in his fall, and appeared to be dangerously
injured; but, soon after his arrival on board of
the ship, he recovered from the effects of the
accident. The rest of the boat’s crew escaped
without any hurt.</p>

<p>Captain Lyons, of the Raith, of Leith, while
prosecuting the whale-fishery on the Labrador
coast, in the season of 1802, discovered a large
whale at a short distance from the ship. Four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
boats were dispatched in pursuit, and two of
them succeeded in approaching it so closely together,
that two harpoons were struck at the
same moment. The fish descended a few fathoms
in the direction of another of the boats,
which was on the advance, rose accidentally
beneath it, struck it with its head, and threw
the boat, men, and apparatus, about fifteen feet
into the air. It was inverted by the stroke,
and fell into the water with its keel upwards.
All the people were picked up alive by the
fourth boat, which was just at hand, excepting
one man, who, having got entangled in the boat,
fell beneath it, and was drowned. The fish was
soon afterwards killed.</p>

<p>When a ship has on board an ample cargo,
or when the fogs set in, and the whales totally
disappear, so as to put a period to the fishery
for that season, there remains no sufficient motive
to induce further stay in the country; the
course of each ship is therefore directed
immediately homeward. On the arrival of
a fishing-ship at the port from whence she
sailed, the mustering-officer of the customs repairs
on board, receives the manifest of the
cargo, (which is a kind of schedule in writing,
containing all particulars respecting it,) with a
true copy thereof, examines into the identity
and number of the crew, by the usual form of
mustering, and places an officer or two on
board, to take charge of the cargo on the part
of the revenue. The duty of these officers is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
to take account of every cask or other article of
which the cargo consists, as it is discharged
from the ship, and one of them accompanies
the same to its destination, carrying an account
thereof in writing, and not quitting the lighter,
wherein it is contained, until he is relieved by
another officer, who is placed in the capacity of
landing-waiter on the premises where the
blubber is warehoused or boiled.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours after the ship arrives
in port, the master is required, under the
penalty of one hundred pounds, to attend at
the custom-house to make his report; that is,
to make affidavit of the built, burden, and
cargo of the ship he commands; on which occasion
he must deliver his manifest to the collector
or other chief officer, (if it has not before
been demanded of him,) under the penalty of
two hundred pounds. At the same time, the
log-book must be produced, and its contents, as
required by law, verified on the oath of the
master and mate, and affidavit also made by the
same persons of their faithful dealings according
to the requirements of the law during the voyage.
After these things are accomplished, the
mustering-officer’s certificate and schedule of
the crew, the commissioners’ license, and the
affidavits of master and mate are transmitted to
the commissioners, who, being satisfied of the
faithfulness of all the proceedings, are required
to order payment of the bounty on demand.</p>

<p>Previous to the cargo being admitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
entry, free from the duties imposed on the
produce of foreign fishery, the owner, importer,
or consignee of the cargo, together with the
master or commander of the vessel, must severally
make oath, each to the best of his knowledge
and belief, that the said cargo was the
produce of fish, etc., actually caught by the
crew of a British-built vessel, wholly owned by
her Majesty’s subjects, usually residing in Great
Britain, etc., registered and navigated according
to law. The importer or consignee of any goods
imported into Britain is required, within twenty
days after the master should have made his
report, under certain penalties, to make a due
entry with the collector or other chief officer of
the customs, at the port where the ship shall
arrive, of all the goods by him imported therein,
and pay the full duties thereon.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">ACCOUNT OF THE DAVIS’S STRAIT WHALE-FISHERY, WITH
STATEMENTS OF EXPENSES AND PROFITS OF A FISHING-SHIP.</p>

<p>Ships intended for Davis’s Strait commonly put
to sea a little earlier than the Greenland ships.
Some years ago, they were in the habit of
sailing in the latter part of February, but at
present they seldom leave their ports before the
beginning or middle of March. On their passage
outward, the Davis’s Strait fishers usually
touch at Orkney or Shetland, for the purpose
of procuring men, and such trifling stores as
are furnished at a cheap rate in these islands,
together with a view of trimming and preparing
their vessels for accomplishing the passage across
the Atlantic. In consequence of the frequent
storms and high seas which prevail in the spring
of the year, the passage across the Atlantic is
often attended with difficulty. The whalers are
constantly liable to meet with icebergs, after passing
the meridian of Cape Farewell, up to their
arrival at the face of the ice connected with the
shore of Labrador. In the night, or in thick
weather, they are particularly hazardous, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
especially in storms. In moderate winds, indeed,
such an intimation of their proximity is
to be obtained, either from their natural effulgence
in some states of the atmosphere, or from
their intense blackness in others, that they can
be generally avoided. But in storms, when
the ship ceases to be under command, they become
one of the most appalling dangers which
can be presented to the navigator.</p>

<p>Two most fatal shipwrecks occurred in
the Davis’s Strait fleets; the Royalist, captain
Edmonds, and the London, captain Matthews,
were lost, with all hands; the former
among icebergs, in 1814, and the latter, as
it is supposed, in a similar way, in 1817.
Captain Bennet, of the Venerable, was in
company with the Royalist immediately before
she was wrecked. They fell in with
drift-ice at eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, April the 14th, when a
heavy gale of wind commenced, and continued
twelve hours, after which the wind abated, but
suddenly veering to the north-west, a tremendous
storm arose, which, accompanied with sleet
and snow, continued without intermission during
twenty hours. Before dark of the 15th,
(nautical day,) captain Bennet saw several icebergs,
at which time he believed the Royalist
was lying to windward of an extensive chain of
these islands of ice, among which she was
wrecked in the course of the same night. The
crew probably perished immediately, as the sea
was uncommonly high. In the case both of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
the Royalist and the London subscriptions were
generously opened at Hull, by the owners of
the whalers, for the relief of the bereaved relatives
of the crew.</p>

<p>The fishery on the coast of Labrador commences
occasionally in the month of March.
On this station, which is inhabited by a large
description of whales, some fishers have persevered
altogether, and have sometimes procured
great cargoes. It is, however, a dangerous
fishery. The nights being long and dark on
their first arrival, they are obliged to use lanterns
in their boats, when fish happen to be
struck, or to remain unsubdued at close of day,
for the purpose of keeping the ships and boats
together; on which occasions the stormy weather
that frequently occurs at this season exposes
them to continued danger. Those who
prosecute the northern fishery, after making
the ice at the “south-west,” as the neighbourhood
of the Labrador coast is usually denominated,
proceed almost immediately up Davis’s
Strait towards Baffin’s Bay. If in the month
of April or beginning of May they commence
this navigation, and sail along the edge of the
western ice to the northward, they often find it
joining the ice connected with the west coast of
Greenland, in the latitude 66½° or 67°, and
meet with a considerable barrier of it in 68°,
immediately beyond which, a few leagues from
land, is a good fishing-station. As the ice
opens to the northward, the whales retreat in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
that direction, and the fishers follow as promptly
as possible. The whalers often reach Disko
early in May, but it is generally the latter end
of this month, or the beginning of June, before
they can pass the second barrier of ice, lying
about Hare Island, in the 71st degree of latitude,
and enter the northern inlets frequented
by the whales. The three inlets called the
South-east Bay, Jacob’s Bight, and the North-east
Bay, were most productive fishing-stations
some years ago, but of late they have afforded
but few whales. From hence, if no fish are
found, the whalers proceed to the western part
of the strait, towards Cumberland Island, or
persevere along the east side of Davis’s Strait
towards Baffin’s Bay, to the eastern parts of
which the fish appear to retreat as the season
advances, and as the ice clears away from the
northern and eastern shores.</p>

<p>In Baffin’s Bay, and in the inlets of West
Greenland, the fishery is conducted under the
most favourable circumstances. The water
being shallow in many situations, the boats require
only a small quantity of line, and the
weather being warm, the sailors perform their
operations, if not with pleasure, at least with
comfort to themselves. But at the south-west,
each operation of the fishery is performed under
rather unpleasant and even dangerous circumstances.
Darkness of night, exposure to storms,
and frequency of swells, are all unfavourable to
the fishers. The flensing of a whale at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
south-west is usually more troublesome and
more hazardous than elsewhere, owing to the
prevalent swell, which rarely altogether subsides.</p>

<p>Davis’s Strait fishers, within the present
century, after making a successful fishery at a
distance from land, have been in the habit of
resorting to the bays, there mooring in safety,
until the troublesome process of making-off was
accomplished. On the passage homewards, the
ships usually steer down the middle of the
strait, and proceed sufficiently far south for
avoiding the “Cape-ice,” before they haul up to
the eastward. From thence, the prevalence of
westerly winds in the summer season generally
affords them an easy passage across the Atlantic.
The legislative regulations on the importation
of Davis’s Strait produce are the same as on
cargoes obtained in the Greenland fishery.</p>

<p>Among the Dutch fishers, we find that,
during a period of a hundred and seven years,
included between 1669 and 1778, each ship in
a fleet of a hundred and thirty-two sail, which
proceeded annually to Greenland, afforded to
the owners, on an average, a profit of 3,126
florins; and that, in a period of sixty years,
ending with 1778, a fleet of fifty-three ships,
which sailed annually to Davis’s Strait, realized
to the owners a profit of 3,469 florins per voyage;
thus exceeding the produce of the Greenland
fishery by 343 florins on each ship, per
voyage, after ample allowance is made for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
greater length of the voyage to Davis’s Strait,
together with the additional wear and tear.
Among the British fishers, the advantage seems
also to have been on the side of Davis’s Strait,
particularly of late years. But if we deduct
the value of skins taken by the Greenland
fishers, but not estimated in their cargoes, say
£20 to £30 per ship, and the additional expenses
of a Davis’s Strait voyage, occasioned by
the greater wear and tear, and the provisions
and wages for a voyage, longer by one or two
months than that to Greenland, we shall reduce
the balance in favour of the Davis’s Strait
fishers to a very small sum.</p>

<p>During the four years, ending with 1817,
the amount of the cargoes of the British
Greenland whale-fishing ships, (consisting of
three hundred and seventy-six sail, repeated
voyages included,) was 3,508 whales, which
produced 33,070 tuns of oil, and 1,682 tons
of whalebone. At the same time, 210 ships
employed in the Davis’s Strait fishery procured
1,522 whales, yielding 21,438 tuns of
oil, and 1,015 tons of whale-fins. It seems
worthy of remark, that the whales caught near
Spitzbergen afforded a larger proportion of
whalebone, compared with the quantity of oil,
than the fish of Davis’s Strait; the Greenland
fish yielding a ton of fins for every 19½ tuns
of oil, and the Davis’s Strait fish a ton of fins
for every 21 tuns of oil. It is remarkable
that this should have been the case, when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
consider that small fish afford less whalebone
than large fish in proportion to their produce in
oil, and yet the Greenland fish, which, on the
average of four years, were much smaller than
those caught in Davis’s Strait, have produced
the largest proportion of whalebone. The
whales taken at the Greenland fishery in four
years only average 9½ tuns of oil each, but
those caught at Davis’s Strait average 14 tuns.
It would, therefore, appear that the large whales
caught near Spitzbergen are much stouter
than those taken in Davis’s Strait, and afford
such a large proportion of fins as more than
compensates for the deficiency in the small
whales.</p>

<p>The fluctuating value of shipping renders it
difficult to give a fair estimate of the expenses
of a whale-ship. The Resolution, of Whitby,
burden 219 tons, when new, in the year 1803,
cost but £7,791, including all expenses of stores
and outfit, premiums of insurance, and advanced
money of seamen; while the Esk, of 354 tons
of measurement, launched and fitted out at the
same port in 1813, cost about £14,000. The
ship Resolution was sold in eight shares, and
the sums subscribed by the owners and deposited
in the hands of the managing owners
was £8,000. The balance in favour of the
owners of the Resolution for fifteen voyages
appeared to be £19,473. 10<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em>, besides the
value of the ship, and the value of the outfit
for the sixteenth voyage. If we reckon these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
at £6,520, the profit derived from £8,000,
originally advanced, in addition to the interest
of the capital embarked, will amount to £26,000,
notwithstanding the last three voyages were but
indifferent, of which sum £25,200 has actually
been divided. It is, however, necessary to
mention, that the Resolution, in her first ten
voyages, procured six hundred or seven hundred
tuns of oil above the average of the fishery
during that period, if not more.</p>

<p>The usual expenses of a Greenland voyage,
including outfit, when no cargo is obtained,
may be stated at £2,200, exclusive of interest
of capital and wear and tear. For every ten
tuns of oil procured, there will be an additional
expense of £80 or £90 for discharging and
boiling the cargo, for oil money and fish money,
and for other extraordinaries connected with a
successful fishing. Thus the expense of a ship,
with a cargo of two hundred tuns of oil, will be
at least £4,000.</p>

<p class="center">METHOD OF EXTRACTING OIL AND PREPARING WHALE-BONE,
WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THESE ARTICLES, AND
REMARKS ON THE USES TO WHICH THE SEVERAL PRODUCTS
OF THE WHALE-FISHERY ARE APPLIED.</p>

<p>On the margin of the river, wet dock, canal, or
other sheet of water, communicating with that
wherein the whale-fishing ship discharges her
cargo, are usually provided the necessary premises
for reducing the blubber into oil, consisting
commonly of the following articles.</p>

<p>1. A copper vessel or boiler, three to six, or
even ten or more tuns’ capacity, of a circular
form in the horizontal view, and elliptical in
the perpendicular section, is fixed at the elevation
of six to ten feet above the ground, provided
with an appropriate furnace, and covered
with a tiled or slated shed.</p>

<p>2. On the same, or on a little lower level
than that of the copper, is fixed a square or
oblong back or cooler, built of wood generally,
capable of containing from ten to twenty tuns
of oil, or upwards. Adjoining to this is another
back, sometimes a third, and occasionally a
fourth or fifth, each placed a little lower than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the one preceding it, so that the lowest shall
stand with its base about two or three feet
above the level of the ground. In some very
modern <em>works</em>, the coolers are all fixed at the
same elevation. Each of the backs is provided
with one or more stop-cocks on the most accessible
side, for convenience in drawing the oil
off into casks.</p>

<p>3. Altogether above the level of the copper,
and immediately adjoining it, on the side
directed towards the river or canal, an oblong
wooden cistern, called the “starting-back,” is
usually erected, for containing blubber, which
ought to be a vessel of equal, or nearly equal,
capacity to that of the copper. It is generally
provided with a crane, which, with a winch, or
other similar engine attached, is so contrived as
to take casks either from the quay, or from a
lighter by the side of the quay, and convey
them at once to the top of the starting-back.
Over this vessel is extended a kind of railing or
“gauntree,” on which the casks rest without
being injured, and are easily movable.</p>

<p>4. The starting-back being elevated two or
three yards above the level of the ground, occasionally
admits of a “fenk-back,” or depository,
for the refuse of the blubber, immediately
beneath it; which fenk-back is sometimes
provided with a <em>clough</em> on the side next the
water, for “starting” the fenks into a barge or
lighter placed below.</p>

<p>5. The premises likewise comprise a <em>shed</em> for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
the cooper, and sometimes a cooper’s, or master-boiler’s,
dwelling-house; the inhabitant of
which takes the charge of all the blubber, oil,
whalebone, and other articles deposited around
him.</p>

<p>6. Warehouses for containing the oil after
it is drawn off into casks are also used, not
only for preserving it in safe custody, but for
defending the casks from the rays of the sun,
otherwise they are apt to pine and become
leaky, and,</p>

<p>7. Sometimes “steeping-backs” and apparatus
for preparing whalebone are comprised
within the same inclosure.</p>

<p>The blubber, which was originally in the
state of fat, is found, on arrival in a warm climate,
to be in a great measure resolved into
oil. The casks, containing the blubber, are
conveyed, by the mechanical apparatus above
mentioned, to the top of the starting-back, into
which their contents are emptied or <em>started</em>
through the bungholes. When the copper is
properly cleansed, the contents of the starting-back,
on lifting a clough at the extremity, or
turning a stop-cock, fall directly into the copper,
one edge of which is usually placed
beneath. The copper is filled within two or
three inches of the top, a little space being
requisite to admit of the expansion of the oil
when heated; and then a brisk fire is applied
to the furnace, and continued until the oil
begins to boil. This effect usually takes place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
in less than two hours. Many of the fritters or
fenks float on the surface of the oil before it is
heated, but after it is “boiled off,” the whole,
or nearly so, subside to the bottom. From the
time the copper begins to warm until it is
boiled off, or ceases to boil, its contents must
be incessantly stirred by means of a pole, armed
with a kind of broad, blunt chisel, to prevent
the fenks from adhering to the bottom or sides
of the vessel. When once the contents of the
copper boil, the fire in the furnace is immediately
reduced, and shortly afterwards altogether
withdrawn. Some persons allow the copper to
boil an hour, others during two or three hours.
The former practice is supposed to produce
finer and paler oil, the latter a greater quantity.
The same copper is usually boiled twice in
every twenty-four hours, Sundays excepted.
After the oil has stood to cool and subside, the
“bailing” process commences. One of the
backs or coolers having been prepared for the
reception of the oil, by putting into it a quantity
of water, for the double purpose of preventing
the heat of the oil from warping or rending
the back, and for receiving any impurities which
it may happen to hold in suspension, a wooden
spout, with a large square box-like head, which
head is filled with brushwood or broom, that it
may act as a filter, is then placed along from
“the copper-head” to the cooler, so as to form
a communication between the two. The oil in
the copper being now separated from the fenks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
water, and other impurities, all of which have
subsided to the bottom, is in a great measure
run off through the pipe communicating with
the cooler, and the remainder is carefully
lifted in copper or tin ladles, and poured upon
the broom in the spout, from whence it runs
into the same cooler, or any other cooler, at the
pleasure of the “boilers.”</p>

<p>Besides oil and fenks, the blubber of the
whale likewise affords a considerable quantity
of watery liquor, produced probably from the
putrescence of the blood, on the surface of
which some of the fenks, and all the greasy
animal matter, called foot-je, or footing, float,
and upon the top of these the oil. Great care
therefore is requisite, on approaching these
impure substances, to take the oil off by means
of shallow tinned iron or copper ladles, called
“skimmers,” without disturbing the refuse and
mixing it with the oil. There must always,
however, be a small quantity towards the conclusion,
which is a mixture of oil and footing;
such is put into a cask or other suitable vessel
by itself, and when the greasy part has thoroughly
subsided, the most pure part is
skimmed off and becomes fine oil, and the impure
is allowed to accumulate by itself, in
another vessel, where in the end it affords
“brown-oil.” From a ton, or 252 gallons by
measure of blubber, there generally arises from
fifty to sixty gallons of refuse, whereof the
greater part is a watery fluid. The constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
presence of this fluid, which boils at a much
lower temperature than the oil, prevents the oil
itself from boiling, which is probably an advantage,
since, in the event of the oil being boiled,
some of the finest and most inflammable parts
would fly off in the form of vapour, whereas
the principal part of the steam, which now
escapes, is produced from the water. Some
persons make a practice of adding a quantity
of water, amounting perhaps to half a tun, to
the contents of each copper, with the view of
weakening or attenuating the viscid impurities
contained in the blubber, and thus obtaining a
finer oil; others consider the quantity of watery
fluid already in the blubber, as sufficient for
producing every needful effect.</p>

<p>Each day, immediately after the copper is
emptied, and while it is yet hot, the men employed
in the manufacture of the oil, having
their feet defended by strong leathern or
wooden shoes, descend into it, and scour it out
with sand and water, until they restore the
natural surface of the copper wherever it is
discoloured. This serves to preserve the oil
from becoming high-coloured, which will always
be the case when proper cleanliness is not
observed.</p>

<p>When prepared and cooled, the oil is in a
marketable state, and requires only to be
transferred from the coolers into casks, for the
convenience of conveyance to any part of the
country. Each of the coolers, it has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
observed, is furnished with a stop-cock, beneath
which there is a platform adapted for receiving
the casks. At the conclusion of the process of
boiling each vessel’s cargo manufactured on
the premises, the backs are completely emptied
of their contents. To effect this water is
poured in, until the lower part of the stratum
of oil rises within a few lines of the level of the
stop-cock, and permits the greatest part of the
oil to escape. The quantity left amounts,
perhaps, to half an inch or an inch in depth;
to recover this oil without water requires a
little address. A deal board, in length a little
exceeding the breadth of the cooler, is introduced
at one end, diagonally, and placed, edge-ways,
in its contents. The ends of the board
being covered with flannel, when pressed
forcibly against the two opposite sides of the
cooler, prevent the oil from circulating past.
The board is then advanced slowly forward
towards the part of the back where the stop-cock
is placed, and, in its progress, all the oil
is collected by the board, while the water has a
free circulation beneath it. When the oil accumulates
to the depth of the board, its further
motion is suspended until the oil thus collected
is drawn off. Another similar board is afterwards
introduced, at the furthest extremity of
the cooler, and passed forward in the same
manner, whereby the little oil which escapes
the first is collected. The remnant is taken up
by skimmers. The smell of oil during its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
extraction is undoubtedly disagreeable; but,
perhaps, not more so than the vapour arising
from any other animal substance, submitted to
the action of heat when in a putrid state. It is
an erroneous opinion that a whale-ship must
always give out the same unpleasant smell.
The fact is, that the fat of the whale, in its
fresh state, has no offensive flavour whatever,
and never becomes disagreeable until it is
brought into a warm climate, and becomes
putrid.</p>

<p>Whale-oil, prepared by the method just described,
is of a pale honey-yellow colour; but
sometimes, when the blubber from which it is
procured happens to be of the red kind, the
oil appears of a reddish-brown colour. When
first extracted, it is commonly thick, but after
standing some time a mucilaginous substance
subsides, and it becomes tolerably limpid and
transparent. Its smell is somewhat offensive,
especially when it is long kept. It consists of
oil, properly so called, a small portion of
spermaceti, and a little gelatine. At the temperature
of 40° the latter substances become
partially concrete, and make the oil obscure;
and at the temperature of 32° render it thick
with flaky crystals. It is sold by the tun, of
252 gallons, wine measure. Its specific gravity
is 0·9214. The tun weighs 17 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb.
12 oz. 14 dr. The value of whale-oil, like that
of every other similar article, is subject to continual
variations. In the year 1744, oil sold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
in England for £10. 1<em>s.</em> per tun; in 1754, for
£29; in 1801, for £50; in 1807, for £21;
and in 1813, when the price was the highest
ever obtained, for £55 or £60 per tun.</p>

<p>The application of gas, produced by the distillation
of coal, for lighting the public streets
and buildings, manufactories, shops, etc., which
formerly were lighted with oil, it was apprehended
would be ruinous to the whale-fishery
trade, and certainly had a very threatening
appearance; but hitherto, owing to the amount
of whale-oil lately imported having been less
than the ordinary quantity, this expected effect
of the employment of gas-lights has not been
felt.</p>

<p>When blubber is boiled in Greenland, the
oil produced from it is much brighter, paler,
more limpid, and more inflammable than that
extracted in Britain. It is also totally free
from any unpleasant flavour, and burns without
smell. Hence it is evident, that whatever is
disagreeable in the effluvia of whale-oil arises
from an admixture of putrescent substances.
These consist of blood and animal fibre. This
latter is the reticulated and cellular fibres of
the blubber, wherein the oil is confined, which
produces the fenks when boiled. When putrefaction
commences, a small portion of the
blood contained in the blubber is probably
combined with the oil, and the animal fibre, in
considerable quantity, is dissolved in it. These
substances not only occasion the unpleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
smell common to whale-oil, but, by being deposited
on the wick of lamps, in burning, produce
upon it a kind of cinder, which, if not
occasionally removed, causes a great diminution
in the quantity of light. A sample of oil, which
I extracted in Greenland, about ten years ago,
is still fine, and totally free from rancidity. It
has certainly acquired a smell, but is not more
unpleasant than that of old Florence oil.
Hence, were whale-oil extracted in Greenland
before the putrefying process commences, or
were any method devised of freeing it from the
impurities which combine with it in consequence
of this process, it would become not
only more valuable for common purposes, but
would be applicable to almost every use to
which spermaceti oil is adapted. In fact, it
would become a similar kind of article.</p>

<p>In performing some experiments on oil in
Greenland, during the fishing season of 1818,
I adopted a process for refining oil extracted
from blubber before the putrefying process commenced,
by which I procured a remarkably fine
oil. It was nearly colourless, beautifully transparent,
and very limpid. This oil retains its
transparency, even at a very low temperature.
It is more inflammable than spermaceti oil, and
so pure, that it will burn longer, without forming
a crust on the wick of the lamp, than any
other oil with which it has been compared.</p>

<p>Besides the oil produced from blubber by
boiling, the whalers distinguish such as oozes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
from the jawbones of the fish by the name of
jawbone oil; and inferior oils, which are discoloured,
by the denominations of brown oil
and black oil, or bilge oil. Brown oil is produced
in the way described in the process of
boiling; black or bilge oil is that which leaks
out of the casks in the course of the voyage,
or runs out of any blubber which may happen
to be in bulk, and accumulates in the
bottom of the ship. This oil is always very
dark coloured, viscous, and possessed of little
transparency.</p>

<p>Whalebone, or whalefins, as the substance
is sometimes, though incorrectly, named, is
found in the mouth of the common Greenland
whale, to which it serves as a substitute for
teeth. It forms an apparatus most admirably
adapted as a filter for separating the minute
animals on which the whale feeds from the
sea-water in which they exist. The Lawgiver
of all the creatures, whether rational or irrational,
has fitted them with organization appropriate
for the purposes for which they live, and
has provided them with all that is needful,
according to their rank, for the happiness of
their lives. The care which is bestowed upon
the animals who do not recognise Him is in
unison with that more tender kindness which
he has manifested to such as have a mind to
meditate on his perfections, and a heart wherewith
to love him and adore.</p>

<p>The whalebone is a substance of a horny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
appearance and consistence, extremely flexible
and elastic, generally of a bluish black colour,
but not unfrequently striped longitudinally
white, and exhibiting a beautiful play of colour
on the surface. Internally, it is of a fibrous texture,
resembling hair, and the external surface
consists of a smooth enamel, capable of receiving
a good polish. When taken from the whale,
the whalebone consists of laminæ, connected by
what is called the gum in a parallel series, and
ranged along each side of the mouth of the
animal. The laminæ are about three hundred
in number, in each side of the head. The
length of the longest blade, which occurs near
the middle of the series, is the criterion fixed
on by the fishers for designating the size of the
fish. Its greatest length is about fifteen feet.
The two sides or series of the whalebone are
connected at the upper part of the head or
crown-bone of the fish, within a few inches of
each other, from whence they hang downwards,
diverging so far as to inclose the tongue between
their extremities; the position of the blades
with regard to each other resembles a frame of
saws in a saw-mill; and, taken altogether,
they exhibit in some measure the form and
position of the roof of a house. The smaller
extremity and interior edge of each blade of
whalebone, or the edge annexed to the tongue,
are covered with a long fringe of hair, consisting
of a similar kind of substance to that which
constitutes the interior of the bone. Whale-bone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
is generally brought from Greenland in
the same state as when taken from the fish,
after being divided into pieces, comprising ten
or twelve laminæ in each. Of late years, the
price has usually been fluctuating between £50
and £150 per ton. It becomes more valuable
as it increases in length and thickness.</p>

<p>In cleansing and preparing the whalebone,
the first operation, if not already done, consists
of depriving it of the gum. It is then put into
a cistern containing water, till the dirt upon its
surface becomes soft. When this effect is sufficiently
produced, it is taken out piece by piece,
laid on a plank placed on the ground, where
the operator stands, and scrubbed or scoured
with sand and water, by means of a broom or
piece of cloth. It is then passed to another
person, who, on a plank or bench, elevated to a
convenient height, scrapes the root-end, where
the gum was attached, until he produces a
smooth surface; he, or another workman, then
applies a knife or a pair of shears to the edge,
and completely detaches all the fringe of hair
connected with it. Another person, who is
generally the superintendent of the concern,
afterwards receives it, washes it in a vessel of
clean water, and removes with a bit of wood
the impurities out of the cavity of the root.
Thus cleansed, it is exposed to the air and
sun, until thoroughly dry, when it is removed
into a warehouse or other place of safety and
shelter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Before it is offered for sale, it is usually
scrubbed with brushes and hair-cloth, by which
the surface receives a polish, and all dirt or dust
adhering to it removed; and, finally, it is packed
in portable bundles, consisting of about one
hundred weight each. The size-bone, or such
pieces as measure six feet or upwards in length,
are kept separate from the under size, the latter
being usually sold at half the price of the former.
Each blade being terminated with a quantity of
hair, there is sometimes a difficulty in deciding
whether some blades of whalebone are size or
not. Owing to the diminished value of under-sized
bones, and more particularly in consequence
of the captain and some of the officers
engaged in a fishing-ship having a premium on
every size fish, it becomes a matter of some importance
in a doubtful case to decide this point.
From a decision which, I understand, has been
made in a court of law, it is now a generally
received rule, that so much of the substance
terminating each blade as gives rise to two or
more hairs is whalebone; though in fact the
hair itself is actually the same substance as that
of which the whalebone is composed.</p>

<p>The oil produced from the blubber of the
whale, in its most common state of preparation,
is used for a variety of purposes. It is used
in the lighting of the streets of towns, and
the interior of places of worship, houses, shops,
manufactories, etc.; it is extensively employed
in the manufacture of soft soap, as well as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
the preparing of leather and coarse woollen
cloths; it is applicable in the manufacture of
coarse varnishes and paints, in which, when
duly prepared, it affords a strength of body
more capable of resisting the weather than paint
mixed in the usual way with vegetable oil; it
is also extensively used for reducing friction in
various kinds of machinery; combined with tar,
it is much employed in ship-work, and in the
manufacture of cordage, and either simple, or
in a state of combination, it is applied to many
other useful purposes.</p>

<p>One of the most extensive applications of
whale-oil, that for illumination, has suffered
a considerable diminution, in consequence of
the appropriation of gas from coal to the
same purpose. This discovery, brilliant as
it is acknowledged to be, which in its first application
bore such a threatening aspect against
the usual consumption of oil, may be the means
of bringing the oil of the whale into more extensive
use than it has at any former period
been. Whale-oil, in the most inferior qualities,
is found to afford a gas which, in point of brilliancy,
freeness of smell, and ease of manufacture,
is greatly superior to that produced from coal.
In places where coal is not very cheap, gas, it
seems, can be produced from oil at about the
same expense as coal-gas; consequently, the
numerous advantages of the former will render
it highly preferable. Whale-oil, when free
from the incombustible and contaminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
animal matters which are usually dissolved in
it in consequence of putrefaction, is, then, applicable
to a variety of purposes, in which the
common oil cannot conveniently be employed.
Even in its unrefined state, whale-oil frequently
obtains an unmerited bad character for burning,
when the fault lies in those who have the charge
of the lamps in which it is consumed. Want of
proper cleanliness, the use of wicks of too great
diameter, and sometimes in a damp state, are
common errors inimical to the obtaining of a
good light.</p>

<p>The fenks, or ultimate refuse of the blubber
of the whale, form an excellent manure, especially
in soils deficient in animal matter. Fenks
might be used, it is probable, in the manufacture
of Prussian blue, and also for the production
of ammonia. Footing, which is the
finer detached fragments of the fenks, not
wholly deprived of oil, may be used as a cheap
material in the formation of gas. Whale’s tail
can be converted into glue, and is extensively
used in the manufacture of this article, especially
in Holland. It forms, as I have already
mentioned, chopping-blocks for the fishers. The
jawbones, with the skull or crown-bone of the
whale, are the largest found in nature. They
are sometimes met with of the length of twenty-five
feet. Jawbones are used as the ribs of
sheds, and in the construction of arches and
posts of gateways.</p>

<p>Whalebone, when softened in hot water, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
simply by heating it before a fire, has the property
of retaining any shape which may then
be given to it, provided it be secured in the
required form until it becomes cold. This property,
together with its great elasticity and
flexibility, renders it capable of being applied
to many useful purposes. The first way in
which it seems to have been employed was in
the stays of ladies. Its application to this purpose
was at one period, when the quantity imported
was small, so general that it attained, in
the wholesale way, the price of £700 per ton.
Of late years, however, it has fallen somewhat
into disrepute, some ladies preferring to support
themselves with plates of steel. There has been
for many years an extensive consumption of
this article in the manufacture of umbrellas and
parasols. The white enamel (found in some
specimens of whalebone) has been fabricated
into ladies’ hats, and a variety of ornamental
forms of head-dresses; and the black enamel is
employed, in the same way as cane, in the construction
of the seats or backs of chairs, gigs,
sofas, etc. The hair on the edge of the whalebone
answers every purpose of bullock’s hair in
stuffings for chairs, sofas, settees, carriages, mattresses,
cushions, etc. An attempt has been
made to build whale-boats of this material, but
the great alteration which takes place in its
dimensions, in different states of the atmosphere,
on account of its ready absorption of
moisture, renders it inapplicable. It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
used with a much better effect, in the construction
of portmanteaus, travelling-trunks,
hygrometers, the ram-rods of fowling-pieces,
fishing-rods, the shafts, springs, and wheels
of carriages, and various other articles.</p>

<p class="center">NARRATIVE OF PROCEEDINGS ON BOARD THE SHIP ESK,
DURING A WHALE-FISHING VOYAGE TO THE COAST OF
SPITZBERGEN, IN THE YEAR 1816; PARTICULARLY RELATING
TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE SHIP UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES
OF PECULIAR DANGER.</p>

<p>The ship Esk sailed from Whitby on the 29th
of March, 1816. We entered the frigid confines
of the Icy Sea, and killed our first whale on the
25th of April. On the 30th of April, we forced
into the ice with a favourable wind, and after
passing through a large body of it, entered an
extensive sea, such as usually lies on the western
coast of Spitzbergen at this season of the
year, early on the morning of the following day.
The wind then blowing hard south south-east,
we kept our reach to the eastward until three
o’clock in the afternoon, when we unexpectedly
met with a quantity of ice, which interrupted
our course. We then <em>wared</em> by the way of
avoiding it, but soon found, though the weather
was thick with snow, that we were completely
embayed in a situation that was truly terrific.</p>

<p>In the course of fourteen voyages, in which
I had before visited this inhospitable country, I
passed through many dangers wherein my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
life, together with those of my companions, had
been threatened; but the present case, where
our lives seemed to be at stake for a length of
time, exceeding twelve hours, far surpassed in
awfulness, as well as actual hazard, anything
that I had before witnessed. Dangers which
occur unexpectedly and terminate suddenly,
though of the most awful description, appear
like a dream when they are past; but horrors
which have a long continuance, though they in
some measure decrease in their effect on the
mind by a lengthened contemplation of them,
yet they leave an impression on the memory
which time itself cannot altogether efface.
Such was the effect of the present scene.
Whilst the wind howled through the rigging
with tempestuous roar, the sea was so mountainous
that the mast-heads of some accompanying
ships, within the distance of a quarter
of a mile, were intercepted and rendered invisible
by the swells, and our ship frequently rolled
the lee-boats into the water, that were suspended
with their keels above the roughtree-rail!</p>

<p>At the same time, we were rapidly approaching
a body of ice, the masses of which, as hard
as rocks, might be seen at one instant covered
with foam, the next concealed from the sight
by the waves, and instantly afterwards reared
to a prodigious height above the surface of the
sea. It is needless to relate the means by
which we attempted to keep the ship clear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
the threatened danger, because those means were
without avail. At eleven P.M. we were close
to the ice, when perceiving through the mist
an opening a short distance within, we directed
the drift of the ship towards it. As we
approached the ice, the sails were filled, so that
the first blow was received obliquely on the
bow, when the velocity of the ship was moderate.
In this place the pieces of ice were
happily of smaller dimensions; at least, all
the larger masses we were able to avoid, so
that, after receiving a number of shocks, we
escaped without any particular accident into
the opening or slack part of the ice above
noticed. This opening, as far as we could see,
promised a safe and permanent release.</p>

<p>But in this we were grievously disappointed:
for, when we attempted to ware the ship, which
soon became necessary, she refused to turn round,
notwithstanding every effort, in a space which,
in ordinary circumstances, would have been
far more than sufficient for the evolution. In
consequence of this accident, which arose partly
from the bad <em>trim</em> of the ship, and partly from
the great violence of the wind, she fell to leeward
into a close body of ice, to which we
could see no termination. The Mars, of Whitby,
and another vessel, which closely followed us
as we penetrated the exterior of the ice, being
in better trim than the Esk, performed the
evolution with ease, and were in a few minutes
out of sight. In this dreadful situation, we lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
beating against the opposing ice, with terrible
force, daring eight successive hours, all which
time I was rocked at the top-gallant mast-head,
directing the management of the sails, to avoid
the largest masses of ice, any one of which
would have perforated the side of the ship.
By the blessing of God, we succeeded wonderfully;
and at eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the 2nd of May, gained
a small opening, where we contrived to navigate
the ship until the wind subsided, and we
had the opportunity of forcing into a more
commodious place. On examining the ship,
we found our only apparent damage to consist
in the destruction of most of our rudder works,
a few slight bruises on the sides, and a cut on
the lower part of the stern of the ship.</p>

<p>From this time, to the 20th of May, the
fishery was generally interrupted by the formation
of new ice, insomuch that during
this interval we killed but one whale, while
few of our neighbours succeeded so well.
During the succeeding week, we became so
fixed that we never moved except occasionally
a few yards. The next twelve days were
spent in most arduous labour in forcing the
ship through the ice. At length, on the 12th
of June, we happily escaped, though our companions
were, for a short time, all left behind.
On the 27th of June, we had secured thirteen
fish, and our quantity of oil was about 125
tuns. This was a larger cargo than any ship
had procured that we had yet met with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
excepting only one. On the 28th, the John, of
Greenock, commanded by my brother-in-law,
Mr. Jackson, joined us.</p>

<p>After proceeding to the westward, the
greater part of the 28th, we arrived at the
borders of a compact body of field-ice, consisting
of immense sheets of prodigious thickness.
As I considered the situation not favourable
for fishing, the ship was allowed to drift to the
eastward all night. In the morning of the 29th,
I found, however, that she was very little
removed from the place where she lay when I
went to bed. I perceived that the floes,
between which there had been extensive spaces,
were now in the act of closing; and attempted,
by lowering four boats, to tow the ship through
an opening at a short distance from us. At the
moment when we were about to enter it, it
closed. In attempting to get the ship into the
safety of an indentation, which appeared calculated
to afford a secure retreat, a small piece of
ice came athwart her bow, stopped her progress,
and she was in a minute afterwards subjected
to a considerable squeeze. From none, however,
of the pieces of ice around us did we apprehend
any danger, particularly as the motion of the
ice soon abated. There was a danger, however,
on the larboard quarter, of which we were
totally unconscious. The piece of ice that
touched the ship in that part, though of itself
scarcely six yards square, and more than one
yard above the water, concealed beneath the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
surface of the sea, at the depth of ten or twelve
feet, a hard pointed projection of ice, which
pressed against the keel, lifted the rudder, and
caused a damage that had nearly occasioned the
loss of the ship. About an hour and a half
after the accident, the carpenter, having sounded
the pump, discovered to our great concern and
amazement a depth of eight and a half feet
water in the hold. This was most alarming;
with despair pictured in every face, the crew
set on the pumps; a signal of distress was at
the same time hoisted, and a dozen boats approached
us from the surrounding ships. In
the space of four hours, the water had lowered
to nearly four feet, but one of the pumps
becoming useless, and bailing being less effectual
than at first, the water once more resumed
its superiority and gained upon us.</p>

<p>Something, therefore, was now to be done, to
stop, if possible, the influx of the water. As
the pumping and bailing could not possibly be
continued by our own ship’s company, it was
necessary to make use of some means to attempt
a speedy remedy whilst our assistants were
numerous. As there was a probability that a
bunch of rope-yarns, straw, or oakum, might
enter some of the larger leaks, and retard the
influx of water, if applied near the place through
the medium of a fothering-sail, (that is, a sail
drawn by means of ropes at the four corners,
beneath the damaged or leaky part,) we in the
meantime prepared a lower studding-sail, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
sewing bunches of these materials, which, together
with sheets of old thin canvas, whalebone-hair,
and a quantity of ashes, fitted it well for
the purpose. Thus prepared, it was hauled
beneath the damaged place, but not the least
effect was yet produced. We set about unrigging
the ship, and discharging the cargo and
stores, upon a flat place of the floe, against
which we had moored, with the intention of
turning the ship keel upward. My own sailors
were completely worn out, and most of our auxiliaries
wearied and discouraged; some of them
evinced, by their improper conduct, their wish
that the ship should be abandoned. Before
putting our plan in execution, we placed twenty
empty casks in the hold, to act against a quantity
of iron ballast which was in the ship,
caulked the dark lights, removed all the dry
goods and provisions that would injure with
the wet, secured all the hatches, skuttles, companion,
etc., then, erecting two tents on the ice,
one for sheltering myself, and the other for the
crew, we ceased pumping, and permitted the
ship to fill. At this crisis, men of whom I had
conceived the highest opinion for firmness and
bravery greatly disappointed my expectations.
Among the whole crew, indeed, scarcely a dozen
spirited fellows were to be seen.</p>

<p>As no ship could with propriety venture near
us, to assist in turning the Esk over, on account
of the hazardous position of the ice around her,
we had no other means of attempting this singular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
evolution than by attaching purchases to
the ice from the ship. Everything being prepared,
while the water flowed into the ship, I
sent our exhausted crew to seek a little rest.
For my own part, necessity impelled me to endeavour
to obtain some repose. I had already
been fifty hours without rest, which unusual
exertion, together with the anxiety of mind I
endured, caused my legs to swell and become so
extremely painful, that I could scarcely walk.
Spreading, therefore, a mattress upon a few
boards, laid on the snow within one of the tents,
notwithstanding the coldness of the situation,
and the excessive dampness that prevailed from
the constant fog, I enjoyed a comfortable repose
of four hours, and arose considerably refreshed.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, about three <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, on
the 1st of July, I proceeded with all hands to
the ship, which, to our surprise, we found had
only sunk a little below the sixteenth mark externally,
while the water but barely covered a
part of “’tween decks within.” Perceiving that
it was not likely to sink much further, on account
of the buoyancy of the empty casks, and the
materials of which the ship was composed, we
applied all our purchases, but with the strength
of 150 men we could not heel her more than
five or six stakes. When thus careened, with
the weight of two anchors suspended from the
mast, acting with the effect of powerful levers
on the ship, I accompanied about 120 men on
board. All these being arranged on the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
side of the deck, ran suddenly to the lower side,
when the ship fell so suddenly on one side that
we were apprehensive she was about to upset,
but after turning a little way the motion ceased.
The tackles on the ice being then hauled tight,
the heeling position of the ship was preserved,
until we mounted the higher part of the deck,
and ran to the lower as before. At length, after
a few repetitions of this manœuvre, no impression
whatever was produced, and the plan of
upsetting the ship appeared quite impracticable.</p>

<p>The situation of the ship being now desperate,
there could be no impropriety in attempting to
remove the keel and garboard strake, which
prevented the application of the fothering, for,
whatever might be the result, it could scarcely
be for the worse. These incumbrances being
removed, the sail for fothering was immediately
applied to the place, and a vast quantity of
fothering materials thrown into its cavity, when
it was fairly underneath. Over this sail we
spread a fore-sail, and braced the whole as tight
to the ship as the keel-bolts, which yet remained
in their horizontal position, would admit. The
effect was as happy as we could possibly have
anticipated. Some time before all these preparations
were completed, our people, assisted
by the John’s crew, who, after a short rest, had
returned to us, put the three pumps and bailing
tubs in motion, and applied their energies with
such effect that in eleven hours the pumps
sucked! In this time, a depth of thirteen feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
water was pumped out of the hold, besides the
leakage. The John’s crew on this occasion exerted
themselves with a spirit and zeal which
were truly praiseworthy. As the assistance of
carpenters was particularly needed, we fired a
gun, and repeated our signal of distress, which
brought very opportunely two boats, with six
men each, from the Prescot, and the same number
from our tried friend, Mr. Allen, of the
North Britain. As we likewise procured the
carpenters of these ships, together with those of
the John, they commenced operations by cutting
through the ceiling, between two frames of
timbers directly across the hold, at the distance
of about twenty-six feet from the stern-post; a
situation which, we were assured, was on the
fore part of the leak, or between the leak and
the body of the ship. The timbers in this
place were unhappily found so closely connected
that we had to cut away part of one of
the floors, that we might come at the outside
plank, and caulk the crevices between it and
the timbers; which operation, on account of
the great depth of timber, and the vast flow of
water that issued at the ceiling, was extremely
difficult, tedious, and disagreeable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile that we had good assistance, I
allowed our crew four hours’ rest, half of them
at a time, for which purpose some of their beds
were removed from the ice to the ship. Here,
for the first time during four days, they enjoyed
their repose; for on account of the cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
and damp that prevailed when they rested on
the ice, several of them, I believe, never slept.
Some of the John’s people returning to us,
swayed up the top-mast, and rigged most of the
yards, while our men were employed stowing
the main-hold, which, by the floating of the
casks, was thrown into a singular state of disorder.
Some of the casks were found without
heads, and all the blubber lost, and many were
found bilged, or otherwise damaged.</p>

<p>After the carpenters had completely cleared
the roomstead—that is, the space between any
two ribs or frames of timbers in a ship—they
drove oakum into it, along with an improved
woollen sheathing substance; and occasionally,
where the spaces were very large, pieces of fat
pork. The spaces or crevices between the
planks of the ceiling and the timber being then
filled, all the above substances were firmly
driven down by means of pine wedges, and the
spaces between each of the wedges caulked.
This would have been very complete, had not
the increased flow of the water overcome the
pumps, and covered the ceiling where the carpenters
were at work. They were therefore
obliged to wedge up the place with great expedition;
and being at the same time greatly
fatigued, the latter part of the operation was
accomplished with much less perfection than I
could have wished.</p>

<p>Hitherto calm weather, with thick fog, having
constantly prevailed, was the occasion of several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
ships remaining by us and affording assistance,
which would otherwise have left us. But the
weather having now become clear, and a prospect
of prosecuting the fishery being presented,
every ship deserted us, except the John, and
she was preparing to leave us likewise. In the
state of extreme jeopardy in which we were still
placed, the love of life, on the part of the crew,
determined them to attempt to quit the ship,
and take refuge in the John as soon as she
should attempt to leave us. I was confident,
through the information I had received, that
unless the assistance of the John were secured,
the Esk, after all the labour bestowed on her,
and the progress which had been made towards
her preservation, must yet be abandoned as a
wreck. At length, I yielded to the request of
my whole crew, and made a proposal to captain
Jackson, who agreed on certain conditions, involving
the surrender of a large proportion of
our cargo, to stay by us and assist us until our
arrival at some port of Shetland. The original
of this contract was voluntarily signed by every
individual of both ships’ companies. A subsequent
agreement of a more explicit kind, on the
part of masters and owners of the Esk and the
John, was drawn out and signed by myself and
Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>These agreements being fully understood
and signed, the John hauled alongside of the
ice, which had now opened near the Esk for
the first time since the accident, and took on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
board the whole of our loose blubber, estimated
at seventy-eight butts and fifty-eight
butts, in twenty-five casks, together with
half our whalebone, as agreed. Everything
now went on favourably, and whilst our crew
and assistants were in full and vigorous employment,
I retired to seek that repose which
my wearied frame stood greatly in need of. On
the 5th July, assisted by all hands from the
John, the stowing of the hold and the rigging
of the ship were completed, and, under a moderate
breeze of wind, we left the floe, but what
was our astonishment and mortification to find
that the ship could not be guided! The rudder
had become perfectly useless, so that with the
most appropriate disposition of the sails possible,
and the requisite position of the helm, the
ship could not be turned round, or diverted in
the least from the course in which the impetus
of the wind on the sails was the most naturally
balanced. This was an alarming disappointment.
However, as the ship was in such constant
danger of being crushed in the situation
where she lay, the John, with the greatest difficulty
imaginable, towed us three or four miles
to the eastward, into a place of comparative
safety. Here we rectified our rudder, and
arranged for the trimming of the ship more by
the stern, to compensate in some degree for the
loss of the after-keel. When these matters
were completed, on account of strong wind and
thick weather, we could not, without imminent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
danger, attempt to penetrate the compact body of
ice which at this time barred our escape to the
sea, and I took the advantage of the opportunity
to procure a long rest. The attention of the
carpenters in caulking the ceiling of the ship,
together with the advantage derived from the
fothering sails, had now produced an effect so
considerable, that on Sunday, the 7th of July,
the original leakage was found to be reduced
nearly four-fifths. During an hour, in which
we were engaged in Divine service, the pumps
were allowed to “stand;” two and a half feet
of water, which in this interval flowed into the
hold, was pumped out in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>After various alarms and careful attention to
the leakage, together with the unremitting diligence
of the crew in the use of the pumps, we
descried land on the 23rd of July, and approached
within three or four miles of the coast
of Shetland. In the evening, the John having
fulfilled the articles of agreement as far as was
required, we sent the twelve men belonging
to her crew on board, and after receiving from
them a supply of fresh water, they left us with
three cheers, and the usual display of colours.
We were now left to sail by ourselves; our
progress was in consequence rather slow. At
daylight of the 27th, we were rejoiced with a
sight of our port. Knowing the flow of water
to be sufficient for the ship, and there being a
probability of reaching the harbour before the
tide was too much fallen, we pressed towards it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
with every sail we could set, and having received
a pilot as we approached the pier, we immediately
entered the harbour, and grounded at
half-past five <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> in a place of safety.</p>

<p>Thus, through the peculiar favour of God, by
whose influence our perseverance was stimulated,
and by whose blessing our contrivances
were rendered effectual, happily terminated a
voyage at once hazardous, disastrous, and
interesting. Men whose lives have been exposed
to dangers so fearful and imminent, may
reasonably be expected to be influenced by a
vivid sense of the nearness of eternity, and to
feel the powers of the world to come. It is the
prerogative of the Christian religion, whilst it
prepares men for death, to take away undue
apprehensions of it; to furnish consolation of
unspeakable value, when it is present; and to
light up the distant and unknown future, with
the peace and happiness of the hope of eternal
life. To the rude and courageous mariner, as
well as to the inhabitants of refined and luxurious
homes, God’s message is one and the same. It
is suitable, and worthy of acceptation, on sea
and on land, in sickness and in health, when
we expect instant removal from our present
temporary dwelling-place, or look forward to
the activities and cares of a protracted life.
To every one of us the Almighty is saying,
Repent, believe, and live—promising a free and
complete pardon through the death of his Son,
and engaging, to those who welcome and obey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
his message, that they shall live under the
smile of His countenance and the protection of
his power.</p>

<p>Intelligence relative to the distressed state of
the ship, and the helplessness of her situation,
reached Whitby the day before us, and, in consequence
of exaggerations respecting the loss of the
crew, involved every interested person in deep
distress. Throughout the town, and in a great
measure throughout the neighbourhood, the
event was considered as a general calamity.
Some of the underwriters on the Esk, I was informed,
had offered sixty per cent. for the reassurance
of the sums for which they were
liable, but such was the nature of the risk, as
ascertained from the information of some ships’
crews, by whom we had been assisted, that no
one would undertake the assurance, even at
this extraordinary premium. The hearty congratulations
I received on landing, from every
acquaintance, were almost overwhelming, and
these, with the enhanced endearments of my affectionate
and enraptured wife, amply repaid
for all the toils and anxieties of mind that I had
endured.</p>

<p>On the tide ebbing out, the Esk was left dry,
on which, for the first time since the accident,
the whole of the water was drawn out of the
hold by the pumps. The next tide, the ship
was removed above the bridge to a place of
perfect safety, where the pumps being neglected,
the water in the course of two tides rose nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
as high within as without. After the cargo was
discharged, the ship was put into dock, and it
was found that, excepting the loss of twenty-two
feet of keel, and the removal of a piece of the
starboard garboard strake, nine feet in length,
with a portion of dead-wood brought home
upon deck, no other damage of consequence had
been produced by the ice. The whole expense
of repairs did not, I believe, exceed £200.
Though the sacrifice of nearly one-half of our
cargo was a considerable disappointment to the
owners, who had been apprized of our success
in fishery, yet, when compared with the salvage,
which might have been demanded had no contract
been entered into for the assistance of the
John, the sacrifice appeared to have been a
material benefit, having been productive of the
saving of perhaps £2,000. The approbation of
my conduct by the owners, Messrs. Fishburn and
Brodrick, was testified by their presenting to
me a gratuity of £50; and the sense entertained
by the Whitby underwriters, of the preservation
of the ship, was pleasingly manifested
by a present of a handsome piece of plate.</p>

<p>I may add, in conclusion, that the whole of
my crew, excepting one individual, returned
from this adventurous and trying voyage in
safety, and in general in a good state of health.
Several of the men, indeed, were affected more
or less by the excessive fatigue, and by the
painful exposure to cold and damp, while resting
on the ice; but all of them were, in a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
measure, restored before our arrival at home,
excepting one man; he, poor fellow, being of a
weak constitution, suffered severely from the
inclement exposure, and died soon after he
arrived in port.</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
